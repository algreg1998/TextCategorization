My Mom used Oil of Olay when I was younger and her skin was always beautiful. But I thought it was just natural. Then I tried the Regenerist and in a WEEK my skin was visibly softer, smoother and actually supple!! I CANNOT BELIEVE I have a soft face. You have to try this because if it made this drastic change in my rough, dry, peeling skin it will work on ANYONE!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product makes me feel young and fresh because it opens up my pores and it allows me to breathe with some sort of comfort.
Very smooth - goes on easily, immediately absorbs into skin and never feels greasy. Keeps skin looking fresh and natural. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I have been using this cream for a couple of years now and love it! I use it daily and love the way my skin feels after putting it on. I also like the scent. It is not over powering but subtle.. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have used Olay products since I was 16, now I am 66. I would not change for anything. Love them all. You keep getting better all the time. Keep sending me your updates. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great smell and feel. Does wonders to my skin. Very nourishing. Has a quality that intensive the moisture in my skin.
Really love how well this moisturizes my skin without feeling oily. I do wish it helped a little more with wrinkles/crows feet, but still love the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
My face soaks this up and is happy all day long. Very happy with this product. It's like aroma therapy for the skin
I really did like this. It took a little longer for the results I had hoped for but I realize if you keep a good regiment it will work really well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have used the product since I was 16 I have tried others just not the same.my mom used it how I learned about it
This product has recently changed its formula. I have been using the old formula for years and probably prefer that formula over the new one but it is still too early to judge for certain. I definitely prefer the white dispenser top over the new black one since the residue looks very unappealing on a black surface. Does not look clean which is what you would want your facial products to represent. Overall I still like this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product is very good and smells sensational. I recommend for all who have ashy skin! I'm VSOP by nature . Very smooth On point skinn
This product is great because it is one of the best moisturizers I have found
I use this cream after cleansing every morning and it literally leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. It's even better when I apply after using Olay Regenerist micro dermabrasion treatment land peel activating serum. I'll the products I use on my face from cleansing to eye treatment is Olay and I have been for years. I am 62 but look 10 years younger because my skin is so soft and what wrinkles I do have are very shallow. Love, love, love. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love my skin again, because it's smoother and softer,my pores are less noticeable, and younger looking
I have used these products for years. My skin looks great. Although I find that sometimes I get a white residue on my face. I do get compliments on like, you look 40, I can't believe you are 50! I believe in Olay products and its results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Works well with skin contour hides blemishes and wrinkles
Have help me look younger for 10 years. Great product for aging skin, recommended to people with heavy rinklles.
It's not greases and feels good on your skin. It also gives you a beautiful glow. I used it for about two weeks and saw a difference in in my complexion. I would recommend this product to everyone. I brought some for my sister she also loved it. Then she told her friend and now we all are using it and skin looks moor firm then ever
This product is amazing! Awesome work!! It actually works! That's sooooooooo cool!!!
The best product. Helps heal dry damaged skin dark circles around the eyes. Your skin will look amazing.
I've only used it for one week, but I have been very impressed. Using the facial mask of my CPAP machine has caused the area around my nose, cheeks and eyes to become really dry, flaky, and raw looking. But after using the cream for one week, I noticed a drastic improvement to my skin. The areas that are irritated by my nose mask are no longer dry and flaky or red and raw. My skin look very fresh and moist. Other moisturizers that I tried made my face look greasy not at all the look I wanted. Thanks for making a product that does just what it is supposed to do. Love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product is really helpful for dry rough skin and I use their product everyday
Great and amazing because it is more than useful like it is likely to change your life ego and appearance
I have been having problems with dry skin around my chin area. I typically have dry skin anyway and wanted to try this product after using numerous other products that do not seem to help. It took about a week before I started noticing any difference plus, taking extra care on how I cleansed my face. This product is wonderful. I am now hooked after no longer having that tight itching and dry feeling I had. I recommend this product to anyone who really needs something for dry skin. Thank you.

Really hydrates the skin, no dry tight feeling at all.
I love how it feels and how it works but hate the smell. Every other aspect is perfect!
This is a wonderful product leaves skin so soft try it
I love the way this product makes my skin feel it doesn't make it feel greasy or oily goes on smooth
It is a great product, because it does everything it says it does. No false advertising with this product.
Best thing ever very good for your skin makes it so soft moiste best feeling ever would recommend for every one highly
This product is very good to your skin . It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft. It also make your skin look like it's glowing, taking ten years off your look.
I love this lotion because I enjoy rubbing my wife's feet with it.
I LOVE the way my skin is left feeling after I use this product!
You should really try this product because it's done so many wonders for me. My skin feels super smooth and looks so fantastic. For real this is the best thing I've ever used for my face
I originally lobe the way it smells and feels when I apply it to my skin. It has enough of what I needed. I recommend this to any person struggleing with dry skin!
I loved this product, it took yrs off , an blotches not so noticeable.... plus it left my face feeling so soft and smelling so .. good !! Thanks
This is some great stuff for my face cuz I'm old and wrinkly and it makes me look younger I feel 31
I have tried everything from all natural to high end designer cosmetics. This is a rock solid product that does it claims!!! It's been part of my regiment for over ten years. I regularly try other products but it's always a waste of time and money!
I have used Oil of Olay off and on, but I always go back to Olay. I use everyday under my make-up and many times as a night time moisturizer. My skin looks smooth and I have very few wrinkles or lines.
It moisturizes well. I could see the difference within a couple of days. It is slightly heavy so I only use it a night.
Very smooth to skin relaxing. It leaves a sensation that revitalizes the youth inside the skin
Very silly feeling but not oily. Has a soft clean smell to it.
This is a great product I even use it myself . My household won't even use anything else if it isn't olay brand.
Product is very nice and works very well got it when worked at factory and my skin had bad reaction to the oil we were using there. It cleared up rather quickly had made my skin feel amazing.
This product leaves my face smooth and glowing and smells super nice i just love it
Makes your skin so soft and has the best smell. If product is applied as directed then results should be positive
My life changed as my face started to glow. Everyone wanted to know the secret... Wasn't a secret after all. Women like sharing beauty tip. I look younger and feel confident.

It's Windex. What more can you say It works great. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
While Windex is better than other glass cleaners, it is not always perfect. It will leave streaks on mirrors sometimes, and takes a good bit of elbow grease to get car windshields clean if they have a lot of bug splotches on them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
It doesn't streak like most window cleaners so I'm pleased with the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I love the product and it cleans, shines and leaves a refreshing smell. Compared to other products it is one of my favorites because you can use it on multiple surfaces.
I grew up using Windex and over the years have tried many other products. Coming back to Windex is like the return of an old friend. Much better product that I remembered. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
It was nice to receive the free bottle. I actually prefer to use the Windex Vinegar based product without the blue coloring. Windex is a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I've been using Windex for decades. It's still a great product. I need to learn to use it on things other than glass. I need to think out of the box! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I been using windex for years and it works great .. It smells good too but it's a little bit too sticky though
Even though I received a free sample, I have used Windex for many years and like how well it works. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have used Windex off and on for years and have found it to be superior over many others as a hard surface and glass cleaner. It will clean most any dirt off of nonporous surfaces, even some inks. I like to use it on my auto glass especially, there is some in my car now. Though it is not perfectly streak free it does leave a fine finish. Besides, I have a little secret to make it a bit more streak free.
The Windex cleaner itself is a great Product ... BUT the Windex spray pumps fail regularly. It is so cheaply made with built-in obsolescence that even if you buy the bulk jugs for refilling them, there's a good chance you won't have a working spray pump to spray it with -- Until they fix IT and make the pumps with some predictable life expectancy -- You Take Your Chances ... GOOD LUCK!

I bought a 99 cent spray bottle and filled it up with Windex so I can clean my windows, mirros, and glass shower doors. It works great! It leaves them all sparkling, clean, and clear. I took away 1 star because it smells awful! Thankfully, the smell doesn't linger. You only smell it as you spray, but after that, it fades away.
I've loved and used Windex for years. I'm a life-long pet owner and you can't own pets with the messes they make without owning Windex. It easily cleans paw and nose prints off of windows and glass it helps to clean up stray hair on all hard floor surfaces and it's absolutely necessary to clean up at messy feeding stations.

I have often tried cheaper brands or making my own window cleaner. I always go back to Windex. The spray bottle works great and is comfortable to hold. The products works great on windows and glass. I have used it on many surfaces in a pinch and it really does a nice job - even cutting grease on my stainless stove top. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I purchase the Windex all in one cleaner for outside windows and love it. However, I have not been able to find the replacement pads in our area. I have looked at Walmart and they do not have them in the Toccoa store. Please tell me where I can find them without having to drive 30 or more miles. Ms. Weeze
We prefer the original Windex with Ammonia D and this gives us a larger volume of it to fill all our spray bottles at a lower price. For those who already have the spray bottles, this can save you a few quarters, and stores in a smaller area than 4 extra spray bottles.
I have used this product for probably 30 years and I have consistently had good results. Spray and wipe, I know it will clean. I have control over the amount of cleaner I spray and the sprayer is usually very good at shooting evenly where I want the cleaner to go.
No matter how many new products come on the market, Windex has always worked very well for my cleaning needs. Especially on my mirrors and glass surfaces. I don't have to worry about streaks and the pleasant fragrance makes the room smell fresh and clean. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The old windex bottle was smaller and the the sprayer that you pushed down on, instead of the trigger type sprayer of today, was more comfortable, much easier to use and sprayed more consistently in all positions. I miss it and wish they still made it.
good stuff, decent price.
Having used Windex on mirrors and windows with great success, I decided they would make my wine glasses sparkle ... which they did, Some friends were over the other night, and when they heard I had done this, they literally pored their wine in the sink. There is no warning on the label, and nothing on the web about this. If properly rinsed and dried after spraying, is there a problem with using Windex to make expensive wine glasses sparkle
I use this product a lot at a care facility somewhere in California, because it works really well. I take turns using it with my friends. Thumbs up for volunteers everywhere.
Consistent product , easy to use, light fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
26 FlOz Original BarCode 19800 70344, Lot P243T 17:16 Don't know if this is a recent design change in the pump or a defective product. When pulling the trigger, it sprays but the trigger does not return properly, and have to wait about 2 seconds to spray again, so a multiple spray is frustratingly slow when doing 15 windows inside and out. I also notice many bubbles in the top of the bottle - maybe because of a defect in the pump. I'd try for the money back guarantee - but of course bought the bottle about 3 weeks ago and don't have the receipt
Good
Instead of buying a new bottle of windex every time, it's nice to be able to keep the old bottles just buy the refill. It's a good price for the refill as well. You get 2-1/2 regular squirt bottles in one refill bottle!
Will this ever come back. It was my favorite and i used it especially for my small bathroom floor
more than windows!
Dries clear and is easy to use if you have a container to refill.
Windex is great for just about anything. I've use it for years and most the time it is streak free. Every once in a while It'll leave a few streaks but I don't mind. Great product!!
It's handy and quickly clean up the dirty glass in and out of mobile windows and other birds saps. only problem is the bottle neck leaks when the cleaning solution liquid is low. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Windex Glass Cleaner is so easy to use. Easy to clean mirrors or windows so fast. I did notice a little streak on the bathroom window even though I did wipe it off with a cloth.
I love your product but PLEASE BRING BACK THE MOUNTAIN BERRY SCENT! Was it such a poor seller that it was discontinued

The only reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a 5 is the oatmeal taste --simple ingredients you know and can pronounce and this bar is very handy when you are On the go and wish to eat something good for you!
I like this improved version better than the old one which I didn't like at all. My hair feels very soft and appears a little fuller. The scent is pleasant - different than old version but is an improvement as well.
I recently got my hair dyed after many years of going without . Pantene was my shampoo of choice after gettibg my hair done. It has retained its luster for weeks since I got my new look. I will stay loyal to pantene products after seeing its results.
This product is good and I am happy with it. I will use it again and would recommend it to others.
This shampoo works and smells great. I use it everyday. Thanks
I thought this shampoo was great it felt good in my hair it didn't dry my hair out or make it overly oily. however the smell was a little strong for me it did smell good just alittle strong that's my only dislike. However if smell really doesn't bother you then you'll love this shampoo. I was given this product to try and review by influencer. However my opinion of the product is my own.
I received this item for free and in my opinion I would love to use this product everyday! It is wonderful, the shampoo lathers really well and has a light citrusy scent. The conditioner is not greasy and I did notice that after a week of daily use that my hair does seem much thicker then usual! I would definitely buy this again.
I love this shampoo so much! It leaves my hair feeling extra soft and lightweight! I do not see a difference with the volume in my hair after using this - that's why I gave this product 4 out of 5. Otherwise, I absolutely love this product so much and will repurchase! *I received this product via Influenster to try for free review
This product is pretty good, but it's not really right for me. It doesn't make my hair as smooth as some other products I use, but that doesn't mean it couldn't do that for yours. It'd like it to provide a little more volume for what it's advertising. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.
My initial reaction was that the bottle was very hard to open and that the scent was not all that great. However, after using it, I loved the way it made my hair feel. It felt soft and the difference in volume from my regular shampoo was noticeable. I received this product for free. Opinions are my own.
So, i like this product because it tends to make my hair a little more dry and for me that is good up top because my hair gets very greasy very quickly. However because of this my hair gets more tangled than usual.
I love this shampoo. I have extremely thick hair but this shampoo lathers up nicely and I an use less than I normally would. It doesn't weigh my hair down like other shampoos either. Like all Aussie products, the smell is fantastic and lasts all day. I tried Aussie for free but these are my own opinions
I loved this shampoo. Ive always loved aussie especially the smell of it. This shampoo is light i have thin staright hair and in always worried anything that promises volume will weigh it down but it left my hair bouncy and soft. I got this product for free but will purchase once i run out because i loved it
I was given this product to rest for free from Influenster but alll opinions are my own. I liked this shampoo for the value and smell, but I didn't find it particularly volumizing. I have fairly flat hair so it takes a lot to work volume on me.
Light, refreshing, and foamy - this shampoo really does a great job cleaning hair without leaving it heavy or stripped. Lots of foam, and lots of volume! I didn't like the packaging, but I did like the shampoo. I received this to review - but my opinions are my own
I'm a fan of this shampoo. The fragrance wasn't overpowering and the thickness of it was good quality. A little of it goes a long way. I have very long way so this is a huge factor for me. It washed very well. As for added volume, there was some slight addition after a couple washes along with the conditioner. I did however, feel like the shampoo stripped a lot of the (good) oils from my hair and it felt dry before conditioning. So I needed to add extra to put the moisture back in. I received this product to review, but the review is completely my own.
My boyfriend and I have both been using this shampoo and we both love it. He has thick hair and doesn't really need to use it at all, but I have really thin hair that tends to just sit flat on my head, especially at the roots. This shampoo smells wonderful and gives me volume all day long. I use it second in my routine....condition first, then shampoo. The ONLY con I have found with it is that it makes my hair stick together when I rinse it out and super hard to brush. Other than that, love it. Disclaimer: I tested this Aussie product for free, but all opinions are my own.
I loved the smell and usually really enjoy Aussie products. My hair is dyed and it did seem to strip the color quickly so I'd prefer a more color friendly option. As far as the volume, I saw no difference in this shampoo and any other shampoo I've ever used. Combined with other products or worked nicely. I received this product for free to review in exchange for my opinions.
I am absolutely in love with this Aussie Aussome shampoo. I have been using it for a little over a week and my hair is visibly shinier, and smooth to the point where I can run my fingers through it and there isn't a single tangle.This leaves my hair feeling really clean, but also really smooth and shiny. This is also a pretty good deal. I recommend using it with the Aussome Conditioner. I received this product for free to review from influenster for testing purposes.
This shampoo made my hair super soft and smooth, and did give it volume. Plus, it smells great! A little bit goes a long way. It's super sudsy, which leads me to the downside. It contains sulfates, and I try to stay away from shampoos containing sulfates. I guess the other thing that was a con was that it's a bit difficult to open the lid when you're in the shower. It can be a bit hard to open. (Disclaimer: I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.)
I really liked this shampoo, it smells great and it added a little bit of extra volume to my hair. There's only one problem - the shampoo bottle is hard to open. Disclaimer: I received this product for free in an Aussie VoxBox from influenster, but all my opinions are my own.
This shampoo feels very lathering on the hair. It really foams up so a little goes a long way. My hair feels clean right after I use it. It has a very fruity smell and the closest that I can compare it to is skittles. The only thing is that this precept doesn't give me the volume that I am looking for or that I was expecting. I will be using other Aussie products just not this one in particular. I did try this product for free but all opinions are my own.
The product is great. Cleans and adds volume to hair without weighing it down.
Enjoyed it
what is the fragrance is it lavender smells like it but ingredients don't say thanks
My husband, two year old daughter and I all used this shampoo and conditioner with no complaints. Left my hair feeling soft and clean. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.
Loved this shampoo! It's lathering and smells great! It's perfect for limp or flat hair and really helps boost up the volume when used more and more. Thanks Aussie!!!
I really like this shampoo! It smelled great and seemed to really work with my hair! But if you are looking for moisture this is not for you.
Lathers well, smells great, cleans thoroughly, inexpensive, removes buildup. Highly recommend. I think it's more of a clarifying shampoo, which I love because nothing makes hair meaner than leftover styling products. I also think, quite frankly, the little kangaroo on the bottle is adorable, not that I only use shampoo endorsed by marsupials. Cheers.
I had to take off one star because of the bottle design for the 13.5oz bottle. Though it is unique, the cap is very tight and super hard to open - I thought it was just me, but upon asking my friends and family that also use this product, they, too, agreed that the cap is too tight and difficult to open. (Especially if you have nails - be super careful, as I have already broken two nails opening this product). It's a shame because the product itself is wonderful - smells great, works great, delivers perfect oomph and volume to your hair, leaves it wonderfully lightly scented, decent price, and is an overall great product. I ended up simply prying the cap open before I go to use the shampoo/conditioner, and pouring it into an empty bottle from another shampoo brand. I would love if a new cap design/technology was looked into for a smoother, easier opening!
I love this shampoo so much! It leaves my hair feeling extra soft and lightweight! I do not see a difference with the volume in my hair after using this - that's why I gave this product 4 out of 5. Otherwise, I absolutely love this product so much and will repurchase! *I received this product via Influenster to try for free review
This is really cute to watch for Mater lovers. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves it, so do his grandfater I :)
This movie was good.
My 4 year old son begged me for this movie and he has watched over and over. If your son likes Cars and Mater they will love this one.
It's a great addition of stories for any little Cars-aholic :)
Still too early to tell but I like how soft it makes my skin. Hoping it gets rid of my dry skin and rash. Dermatologist highly recommended it.
My husband's dermatologist recommended this product we've been using it for some time on his dry skin. It works very well.
sparkle and shine! glitter and glow.. finish the dirt with Finish Quantum Dirt and grease gone with No rinse aid and salt.. love them
The cheaper Finish was leaving white residue on our dishes. This one is better and our dishes don't have as much white residue now.
I love the Lemony smell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cute frame, cant wait until the baby gets here to use it
my family spends alot of time in the sun. We enjoyed paddleboarding a the beach for 4 hours on Saturday morning. With sunscreen protection no one got burned and no irritation
Clean well and like that it doesn't contain wax. be sure and wipe window after seems to make them streak a bit
One of the few car washes that don't have wax mixed in. Great suds to lift dirt
I've been searching for a self tanner that won't make me look more yellow because I'm Asian and my skin is pale and has a warm undertone so I'm already a little yellowish bc I'm asian and even more yellow with olive undertone. So it's really hard to find self tanners with a red undertone which this one has. It doesn't make me deep dark as its name but I'm 2 shades darker with only a little bit of yellow tint when with other self tanners I have tried that people claim are amazing makes me way too yellow or orange to go in public.If it works for a rare case like me, I'm sure it will work with everyone else.It doesn't cost much at least it is worth it to give it a try.
arrived a day after I ordered, color is a little orange but if you mix it with lotion or aloe vera it's good
To prevent smearing, after applying it evenly where you want it, go back to it after a couple minutes and run your fingers over it again. This will even it out better and will make it look natural. Original effect only last a couple days, then it continues to fade out up to 6-7 days.

I've used this product for about a week now, and I love it. After the first two uses (first day) the streakiness went away, so I guess that's just a beginning thing. I've noticed a significant change in the color, my legs finally match my arms. I wore leggings basically all year before using this product for a week. My only sour note is that when the bottle says to use sparingly around the ankles, do it. My ankles were a little dark, but the color lightened up with a little bit of body wash and a luffa. The smell, isn't bad, but it isn't great. I would suggest some kind of coconut or tropical scent to be added. I'm fairly impressed with the scent as it is though considering most self-tanner smell like acid.
the lotion works good and has a nice scent, just make sure you pay attention when applying it around your ankles and knees.....just like they say, it will make those areas extremely dark, making them appear as though they are dirty
I wanted to tan my legs from sandal area up to my upper thighs. Decided to follow the suggestions, so showered and shaved my legs before using it. After drying off, I applied a moderate amount and applied it with both hands making sure there weren't any areas that had it thicker than others. It worked fine. On one later application, I was rushed so left off shaving until a couple hours after applying this, on the basis that it would be dried off enough. That was a mistake, because along with the little whiskers came a lot of the lotion that had been turned to a gunky consistency. Also, because of the rush I didn't have time to make sure it was applied totally evenly, and ended up with a couple streaks which were embarrassing. As long as you apply this after you have shaved any areas as normal, and then take the time to apply it evenly - even to the point that you gently stroke the area again a few minutes after finishing the application to make sure there are no thick spots left - it works. Take care to not put much at all (if any) on areas of dry or hard skin, such as areas of feet and knees, elbows, etc, because they will end up darker than the rest. This works fine. I think I was right to pick this before a darker tan, and apply a couple times, because it looked much better, much more like a real tan and less like something out of a bottle or tube. The lotion itself made my skin noticeably softer for a few days afterwards, so that was a lovely bonus. I could do without the fragrance, but it's not totally unpleasant.
This product does not have the usual smell of so many sunless lotions and I love that about it. The color comes out very natural looking although you may have to apply a couple times to get a good noticeable difference depending on how dark you want to look. I will be buying this product again.
Very effective, If you'r light complexed like I am, it gives you a tan that last about a week
Great value, works great
Was glad to find the product online because it was sold out out the 2 wal-mart stores that I checked. I use it on my legs year around to keep them from being so white.........
Sunless tanner can honestly be hit or miss but I can honestly say this product is right on the money. It comes out with just enough color to see where you're putting it but not too much that it's going to come off on anything, it's moisturizing unlike most tanners so you won't be cringing from dry skin, the smell isn't offensive and the price is really good compared to other tanners. Once it develops it's a really nice natural color with no streaks. I love this product.. Two thumbs up :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This has to be the smoothest creamiest lotion I have ever used in my life.Know I can't live without it
I really like this product. It's a tinted lotion so it makes the application process much easier and less streaks or missed areas. Great color too!!! My only complaint is how splotchy it is between the applications. I do exfoliate daily and maybe that is why but I also have eczema. It just makes it difficult to enjoy it like the rest of the consumers when I have to wait to apply it. I highly recommend this product though.
I usually tan good in the tanning bed and sun but ive been short on time and the tanning bed isnt healthy so i was on here reading reviews and decided to go w/ this one.. i was really iffy about it but i was willing to give it a try.. the first day i used it and it says u will see results in 2-3 hours..i felt like i could but it might have been in my head.. so later that day i put more on and my family was saying i looked darker.. when i put it on a make sure im careful about it so it doesnt go on uneven and stuff.. and it seems to do really good.. the only thing is watch really dry skin..like on the top on my big toes they are really dry and i put it on them and u could tell it looked awful but i just stopped putting it there also it has a slight greasy feeling but its not horrible..and i was working out w/ it on and where i sweat like on my arms u could see it looked like i was dirty but i took a shower and it went away.. but i really do like it.. im just throughing out the warnings .
I have a really good tan on my upper body so when I decided to wear shorts I didn't have a Tan so I wanted to get one fast so I could wear shorts and start to get a real tan.IT REALLY IS STREAK FREE!!! the only bad thing about it is, i would put lotion on my feet ankles knees before i put this on because it made my knees feet and ankles look a bit dirty. But other then that it's perfect. The first time i put it on it really didn't do much at all but the second time i put it on then went to bed when i woke up I had a really nice tan, natural looking and no streaks at all. Plus it didn't leave my palms looking orange or dirty either. I apply it 1 maybe 2 times a week. The smell isn't bad at all, and if you have really dry skin then I would mix it w/ some regular lotion too.
I love this self tanning lotion! It's simple, quick and easy to apply. I usually don't like to use Tanners with a guide color or tint because it settles in my pores and I get those dreaded brown speckels all over, but the tint in this lotion looks great and doesn't settle in my pores. I've always used sprays and always thought that the application and results were the best. Until I tried banana boat deep dark lotion and found the application a piece of cake, especially since using gloves is a pain and stains your hands with most lotions, but banana boat easily washes off palms, way less hassle to apply than sprays, and, for me, the color is much more natural and the color stays true longer before any obvious fading. I'm a convert!!
I have been using this product for over a year now. It has worked very well for me, plus it doesn't rub off on your clothes as long as you give it 15-20 min to dry. As long as you rub it in very well it won't come out streaky, and if you apply it to your knees, elbows, ankle, or face use it very sparingly or mix it with regular lotions to prevent orangeyness. Also if you have light colored skin defiantly DONT think about getting the dark lotion instead of the medium one to get a darker tan. My friend decided to do this and her whole body turned an ugly dark orange color.
I'm very pale and use the Deep/Dark shade and it gives me a natural looking tan....no orange color!! I haven't had any issues with streaking. I do use a self tanner mitt to apply. Does have a slight smell but not horrible.
I really like this gentle cleanser - works great for my dry skin in the winter. Has absolutely no scent, and definitely is a gel/cream cleanser (doesn't foam) and I love that it comes in this handy travel size.
Works just fine.
Fresh and clean face
Love it.
I have been using this product for 2 years! I have always and still do love the feeling of my hair from this product and I've always loved the smell it had always stayed my hair until recently as soon as I get out of the shower the scent is gone.. If they could make the scent a bit stronger to stay into my hair longer that would be amazing but other than that it's a great product! :)
Really like this line especially to be a store shampoo. It does help the hair with straightness. The conditioner is detangling. I have lots of movement using this line especially followed by a light glaze and flat-ironing.
I have very, very long hair (about 28 inches worth), and I've always been a little bit of a shampoo snob, but I was in between shampoos and just ran into the drug store to get something and just happened pick this up. I was so impressed by it! After using this shampoo only once, my hair was incredibly smoother and felt stronger! However, there was one really bad thing about this shampoo + conditioner, and it's the conditioner!!! It stinks!! It literally smells like rotten wet dog, it is so atrocious. Luckily the scent doesn't last long after you get out of the shower, but it makes the washing experience feel dirty. The shampoo smells good, but that conditioner...who thought of that scent
I used this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years when my typical brand kept altering their line of products. They worked pretty well and who can complain about a big old bottle of shampoo for less than 3 My hair had gotten really damaged from being permanently straightened and additional heat damage which is the only reason I switched back when they finally seemed to get things together again. Unfortunately I needed something more moisturizing plus I also believe they changed the scent of the shampoo from a mild clean scent to a tropical one which was a turn off for me. But still was very happy with this line, would recommend it for anyone without very damaged hair.
Tuna is good. Not cheap though.
This is the only tunI buy. If you are a tuna fan this one is the one. Nice white tuna, no fishy smell or taste.
I actually really enjoy this conditioner. Have tried a whole bunch, both expensive and cheap. I have thick, curly and dry hair so I'm pretty particular about what I use. Smell is nice! I used it with the Moisturizing unscented shampoo and feel like the combo of the two is keeping my hair very healthy. I've also noticed less frizz as well. I've only used it a couple times but I only wash my hair once ever 4-5 days or so. Scalp isn't greasy and hair isn't dried out. Curls aren't too frizzy either!
It made my hair super soft and shiny. Left it manageable too. Smells good without being overpowering.
We like this shelf, and found it relatively easy to assemble. The assembly directions aren't really complete, but if you've gotten familiar with the companies website it's pretty easy to figure out. Overall, it looks nice, suits our needs, and we're happy to know it's formaldehyde free. Shipping did cause a little damage to the item (dented in a few areas) but it didn't affect it's functionality and I honestly kind of expected it, given that the product is made of recycled paper, which makes the material pretty soft. It probably won't last forever, but that's okay. We're happy to have it for now and to know that it won't expose our new baby or us to any concerning formaldehyde.
Bought this product with the 32 oz refill bottle of same product. Works great on normal cleaning but I have not used it on any "challenging" cleaning. Citrus scent is nice.
Love love love this shower gel! It smells amazing and works so well! Shipping took forever though and I think the cap to the bottle is busted because its really hard to squeeze and the gel comes out really slow. Its kind of a chore.. (unless that's how they make all the bottles in which case, poor product construction)
Very minimal scent, a little goes a long way. I have well water so no matter how good, I still need a lot of moisturizer post shower. For the price, ingredients, and overall performance, I would recommend.
This product is great! Our only problem is that we can't get the cap to dispense any soap. We end up removing the whole lid. We have the same problem with other soaps with same type of lid.
A little goes a long way. This product lathers well and I love that my children can use this product and be safe from harmful chemicals.
It's like that so why not watch it with them .....
Johnny Depp at his best as the head of fading family estate; oh and he happens to be a vampire. Filled with great jokes and interesting cast. A great movie for a rainy afternoon when you want something different from the usual movie fair. The more you watch it, the more you appreciate the subtlety of the humor. Looks like the cast had great fun filming.
A remember when video at a good price. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Thought the movie was excellent. was well worth the money.
I am a big fan of Johnny Depp. Love all his movies. This was not one of his best but still funny.
Good movie, fun and campy. Doesn't have much in common with the old tv series, but that's fine. We enjoyed it enough to watch it twice.
We've been picking up bargain Blu-Rays waiting for 4K content and find that Best Buy has a great inventory, well organized and competitively priced. I dunno on this one-I like Johnny Depp but he's done better stuff.
its a blu ray. it was a fun movie. love johnny depp.
Not my favorite Depp movie but if you are a fan you have to watch it
Decent comedy for those who like crude humor. Decent.
I'm a big Jonny Depp fan so I had to have this movie
Can't go wrong with a Johnny Depp and Tim Burton movie. Not my favorite but definitely worth watching
I like just about EVERY movie with Jonny Depp, and Michelle Phiefer (i beleive that's the spelling) is great to watch too!
Not one of Johnny Depp's best movies, but good all around fun.
Funny movie. Will capture your attention. Must have for Johnny fans.
I saw this for the first time, it had a few good laughs in it
There were some interesting parts for sure but none the less still a good choice
More a comedy than an extension of the original soap. Still entertaining and true to the original.
"Dark Shadows" is Tim Burton's take on the TV show of the same name and a really cool one, at that. Great cast and a cameo of Alice Cooper. Doesn't get much better.Johnny Depp continues a successful partnership with Tim Burton which began with "Ed Wood" back in the early 90's. Check this movie out.
Funny as heck.. One of Johnny Depp"s funnier movies.
Delightfully cute and funny take on the classic story of Barnabas Collins. Look for the cameos of Angelique, Josette/Maggie, and Quentin - pretty cool! Great music with this good spoof too.
i seen this in theater since the collaboration of burton and depp have good quality in filmmaking and it doesnt fail to be.
vampire & witch fighting each other then Barnabas getting his revenge
As ridiculous as it is, I still love the simplicity of this movie. Just a great movie to watch and not have to think about. Johnny Depp is is usual self and I love how is personality adds to the role. This is not an award winning movie by any means! Nothing too scary, but there are quite a few risque references so it might not be appropriate for the young.
Johnny Depp did really well in this movie. It is different than your usual vampire movie with good comedy.
Good Blu Ray transfer, very fun movie to watch, not Oscar worthy by any means
liked this movie.........................................
Johnny Depp plays another wacky character, his speciality
If you like Johnny Depp and horror movies, you are likely to enjoy this movie (though do not expect a real horror movie...this is more of a comedy).
Loved the 60's TV show, movie was silly, but fun!!
Funny take on the original series. Be sure to catch the cameos from the original Barnabas. The soundtrack added to the movie.
Good movie worth watching and owning for the collection would recommend
Movie was ok. It may be a little too mature to watch as a family movie if you have little ones under 10.
I thought it was funny and interesting movie with a twist.
Ladies working with johnny made this film good. Tastefully done, the original series was a gold mine of strange and swirling horror mayhem. I feel the ending suited to make you remember just how weird the show truly had become.
Definitely better than I was expecting it to be, you can definitely tell this has Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter style to it.
Not into these type of movies normally, but this was an exception!
Some like him. Some don't. But if you like vampires, camp, and don't mind remakes too much, you might like Dark Shadows. Johnny's Barnabas Collins finds himself stranded in the present and has to find his balance, all the while fighting the witch who put him in this position. Does he find love again? Watch it and find out.
I grew up on the old TV Dark Shadows so I was happy to see this come out, I was pleased that Everyone enjoyed it not just me. Some darkness, some sexy moments, and funny without being silly.
If your an old fan of the original series be sure and take this for what it is and enjoy it at that. It's years and years of compiled Dark Shadows compressed into a movie with it's own bend and some humor scattered into the mix. It was entertaining. The sets are incredibly rich as always with a Tim Burton film.
I thought that this was a nice remake of the original and I at least enjoined it. Plus I had downloaded this and had to buy it for my brother.
fine, i am a fan of johnny depp. i like the price and the convenious of ordering on line
A take off on the original Dark Sahdows, wasn't what I was expecting but love Johnny Depp
Once again, Johnny Depp did a really good job getting the character. Pretty solid movie.
nostalgic movie and enjoyed very much. was worth the money spent.
The film works fairly well. The funny bits are funny and the scary bits are... well, I guess they could unnerve some people. Burton's usual color scheme is in effect, so expect a lot of dark colors with red highlights. The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, as the shots tend to be very much in the style of old Hammer Horror films (Horror film buffs should keep an eye out for shots that resemble some of your old favorites). The soundtrack is a nice mix of Danny Elfman's score and 70s rock. This is used to great effect throughout the movie (most notably Nights in White Satin).The film is not Burton's best, nor is it Depp's (Both of which would be Ed Wood in my opinion). It is an entertaining film, nothing particularly special... but there's a sense of nostalgia to it... Both for fans of the show and old Burton fans.
Fun movie. Spouse likes it so we bought it. Decent entertainment for a night in.
What can I say? Any movie with Johnny Depp has GOT to be GOOD!
Excellent movie if you like dark comedies. Johny Depp is excellent, as usual.
Not like the show, but it wasn't too bad to watch.
Having a vague remembrance of the original TV Dark Shadows, I came to this movie with low expectations and it turned out to be pretty fun. I watched it with a fan of the old TV series and she got an even bigger kick out of it than I did. Ok ... it is dumb ... but entertaining nonetheless.
Overall great Tim Burton movie. As always Johnny Depp and Helena Bonam Carter are great.
Great for your home collection expecially it you like Johnny Depp and Michelle Phifer.
a surpisingly good performance by the daughter in this movie.A good movie overall to watch
i watched this movie in the theaters and i loved this movie from the start. this was a remake of the old version of dark shadows. the movie was set in the hippie days in a booming community dependent on the commercial fishing, the movie starts buy a crew of construction workers uncovering what has been buried for years (barbus Collins). as he restore's what once was collin wood he runs into the witch that has cursed him and from their things get very interesting as them compete against one another. i dont want to give to many details but the movie was overall great and need be watched by anyone that likes johnny depp movies.
The movie was funny, acting was great, but it still can't beat the original tv series.
Great acting by Johnny Depp and cast, make a great family movie
I wish it could have ended better to many loose ends...make a part 2
this was a funny movie. johnny depp is super hilarious.
everytime tim burton and johnny depp make a movie you can almost tell its gonna be dark. the fact that they are able to take a average soap opera and revive it 40 years later just goes to show you that you don't need a 100 million dollar budget to make a good movie. acting was great and the special effects were right up the burton avenue. all in all a good mature family comedy
A fish out of water movie that turns into an underdog rising up.
Movie not so great.Johnny Depp lots of fun to watch.
I bought this for my daughter. She is Johnny Depp fan. We watched it. She loved it. It was good but I think I just remember the old series so I was expecting more of that. It was good.
I am a Johnny Depp fan. I enjoyed Dark Shadows. The movie was entertaining and had enough drama within the story. Worth owning!
This movie was listed as a comedy, but it was mostly a dry humor. Still interesting to watch though.
I was looking for a non-scary halloween movie & found this on sale. Its a ridiculous movie but I liked it.
This was a totally awesome movie. Can't wait until part 2 comes out.
While not a really good movie, Johnny Depp does a good job keeping it interesting. For the price, it's a good one to pick up.
Having been a long time fan of the original - this was a welcome treat to watch --- Some pretty racey 'skin' sequences - so not really ment for the youngsters -- but elsewise, a fun film to watch.
Good movie was better than I had heard. I wanted to see because I love the tv series.
Brings me back to the TV series. Fun, well done. Johnny Depp is great.
I got for a cheap price.. The movie was meh okay..
This is a very funny movie that makes fun of the old soap opera Dark Shadows.
I loved this movie, very funny. Have seen once already. I love actor Johnny Depp as Barnabus Collins, & how can u go wrong with any movie Michelle Phieffer is in!
I found the movie Funny, charming and entertaining.
I'll play your silly game and take the points for reviewing the movie. Either you liked it or you didn't.
Good movie to watch with friends around Halloween time.
I remember the old Dark Shadows from back in the day. So different. I thought it was funny and enjoyable.
This isn't the best Depp/Burton movie but it is actually pretty decent. Check it out!
Tim Burton's take on popular daytime Horror Soap Opera. Fans of Depp and Green will enjoy.
Good movie for the price got it on black friday deal
I love Tim Burton,The way he uses his camera angles and shots tells a story in itself. I watch movies from the editors point of view, oddly enough one of my favorite scenes is when everyone is talking at the table and you can see chloe dancing to music in the background !
This is a great spoof on the "Dark shadows" theme. Funny
"I'm not good. I'm not gentle. And I don't forgive." This is one of my favorite movie quotes ever. Having never seen the television series Dark Shadows, except in a clip here and there, I was a clean slate. It's serious, it's funny, it's hysterical. One of those movies you're not sure if it's a dramatic comedy or a comedic drama.
Although I thought it would be funnier...this proves that Johnny Depp is a great versatile actor!
I love the dark humor in this movie. Eva Green is a beautiful woman, and she plays the witch perfectly. If you like dark comedy movies, I recommend you to grab this movie to your collection. Great for Halloween movie night, or any night.
Like every 1966-67 Elvis movie, you have pretty girls in slight outfits, EP loves a girl that another wants (and usually has for a while anyway), EP has to fight someone, EP sings with children, EP has to win something (ie: auto race, boat race, high diving, etc., EP sings really dumb songs but usually has at least one really good one (You Don't Know Me and The Girl I Never Loved), lots of Memphis Mafia in the background (Red West, Ice Cream Man, Charlie Hodge the Barber, Joe and Richard in bit parts at the Clambake - note no clams shown) and EP gets the girl. Las Vegas, Hawaii, Mexico, Florida, anywhere they are all the same and that includes spending 2 hours just looking at this wonderfully handsome man. If you love just seeing him this one is for you.
A good movie especially if you are looking for a good comedy to watch
funny movie diffently recommend alsome romantic comedy
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates [Blu-ray/DVD] [2016] - good family movie.
Great combination with the two lead actors, good movie to watch with friends
Was absolutely surprised by this movie. All the characters are excellent.
This movie is historical.yes it's a silly slapstick comedy. Be prepared to laugh throughout the entire movie.
Good movie. Funny
Really funny and entertaining to watch non stop laughing
Mike and Dave have a lot of fun. They place themselves on the internet needing a date for a wedding in Hawaii. Then ENJOY the movie.
Funny, Funny, Funny! A guys movie for sure! not a date movie!!
Saw this movie in the theatre and had to get the DVD. Laughed all the way through.
Adam and Aubrey are funny as always... worth the purchase
The movie was prett funny, the story line was okay, not the best but wasn't the worst.
Extremely funny movie, dragged on a tad towards the end but overall a good comedy
this is a good time for all those old enough to understand
Not a necessary buy, but it's a decent comedy with a decent-looking 4K release.
This is a good funny movie; not ideal for children. Includes a lot of dirty humor.
It seems like majority of the movie is forcing the funny onto you, there are great parts but fast from being a comedy classic.
Nothing super revolutionary about this film but it has its moments. If you're looking for a few good laughs this might fit the bill.
Don't worry about plot or character development - just sit back, relax and be ready to laugh a lot!!
Picture and sound are really good. The movie is funny in certain scenes.
This movie is pretty funny, not as funny as I expected. But it was a good laugh!
"Nice" guys meet not so nice girls. The movie was funny but the ladies were in charge.
I'm a big fan of ZAC EFFRONS work, so I buy all his films. This is a light and fun movie, the story is interesting and I had a good time. Dont expect Oscar material, but if you want to smile and titalated - this is for you! ZAC is hot and spends a lot of time shirtless - that's good enough for me!
A nice movie with lots of laughs but definitely not for children.
This movie has its ups and downs some really funny parts ands some why did they leave that part in moments
This movie is great, big fan of the cast. Not for kids.
Enjoyed watching this movie, very entertaining for young adults
It was a funny movie. Don't come in thinking it's a oscar winner. It's a fun movie and you will get some good laughs. Not so safe to watch with kids.
Non stop laughter from start to finish. These two guys pair up perfectly to have you rolling with laughs.
I enjoyed watching this funny and somewhat true story. I think that the casting was done well and thought that it was funny!
The cast helps elevate the material here. Some jokes don't work as well as others, but it's a lot of fun. The story grows more familiar by the end, but that's ok. I'd recommend it.
This was a very good and a very funny movie with good acting.
A typical funny movie for Zac Effron. It's worth seeing.
Funny movie nice to sit with friends and laugh at the stupidity of characters.
Funny movie. Not for children or those easily offended by dirty jokes. Typical of the raunchy movies Zac Efron has made lately!
Real funny movie..rated R kids should not see this,adult funny comedy
funny movie from beginning to end. good laughs and no need to think.
Efron is killing it in the comedy movies lately he is funny. Story was based on true events, these guys were funny.
2 brothers need wedding dates and seek potential dates online... What's the worst that can happen?
This movie is funny from beginning to the end haha
This is so funny, if you haven't seen it, go watch it.
My husband loves movies. Just bought this to add to them.
Could have been funnier but all in all alright good buy
Funny, Zack enfran is great, hope they make a segual, those girls were halarious
this was a funny movie and i laughed hard it was a wedding smile
from this point of view, you'll need to triple check your date interviews!
good teenage movie---lots of stupid stuff going on
Funny but not as in a theater I would still buy it though
Thought it was hilarious for the most part but had its serious parts also and I like Efron as an actor in all his movies
This movie is almost exactly what you would expect from the Seth Rogen era of comedy, drug jokes, dirty jokes, awkward moment humor. Although the movie is very funny if you are into that kind of humor. If you like the cast and just want to have a night of laughs, for sure check this movie out. You will have a good time.
Great premises and a great cast, however it just did not entertain me on the level that say Neighbors did.
But it is an entertaining movie. Not really for young teens as there are a lot of adult references.
They make so many movie, and often times there just okay. the writer here must been new, cause it was fressh and funny. real fun.
I thought this was pretty good for a comedy. Some parts were over the top and it did have some pretty gross humor.
Non stop laughs, raunchy and irreverent, a real treat
Full of new types of jokes and stupidity. Boys will be boys girls will be girls.
The whole cast is funny and keeps the viewers laughing.
Two hard-partying brothers place an online ad to find the perfect dates for their sister's Hawaiian wedding. Hoping for a great getaway, instead they find themselves out hustling an uncontrollable duo. Zac was funnier in Dirty Grandpa
Pretty good movie, with some pretty funny parts. I enjoyed it.
Wasn't expecting much from this but ended up laughing nonstop. Hard to ever look at a massage the same after this movie!
I did not see the movie in the theater, I only went by word of mouth from other customers. I was taken totally by surprise with this one.
Not particularly original or insightful, but very funny!!
This wasn't the best movie of 2016 but not the worse either. Actually pretty funny plus Aubry and Anna are good together.
If you are in need of a good laugh watch this movie.
I watched Workaholics & then when i saw that he was in this movie i knew it was going to be good.
It had it's moments that was funny but thats pretty much it.
This was a funny comedic movie with good performances through out
It was funny. A bit corny but still a good movie to watch if you're in the mood to laugh.
It's not the best movie I've seen this year but it kept me laughing and entertained throughout.
I really enjoyed the movie, probably because that's my kind of humor. It was a real plus because of the locale...the place I live.
Great cast and laughs all around. Definitely one of the year's best comedies.
My daughter and her boyfriend got this and really liked it. Very funny movie!
There were some great laugh out loud moments. Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick were great despite some horribly cheesy dialogue at times.
Loved this one . Funny all the way though. Have seen it two times now.
It was an okay movie. I didn't laugh a lot but I chuckled occasionally There were parts that I should not have watched with my 7 yr old though
Just like other comedies that aim to be raunchy, this one works out.
Pretty funny movie. I actually really enjoyed it from start to finish.
My wife and I really enjoyed the movie, lots of laughs.
Good movie lots of fun .you will get lots of laughs
This is hilariously funny. The things that they up to in this are crazy.
Very entertaining movie. Would recommend to any movie lover.
Very funny movie. Anna Kendrick is very good in her role.
Not a bad movie but it was predictable. Aubrey Plaza is hilarious once again.
Funny movie but wouldnt let the kids watch it. Adult humor
Seen in the theaters and good enough to buy..get it soon
This is definitely a funny movie, but I'm not sure how well the jokes will hold up under future viewings.
Very good movie with great blend of gross out humor and family bonding
Very funny movie and worth picking up. Won't be disappointed.
This movie is outrageous, inappropriate, PC incorrect, raunchy stupid slapstick, so over the top that it shouldn't work but, by some miracle mixed with such enthusiastic commitment from everyone involved, this thing fires on all cylinders. It has the same OMG powerhouse energy of classics like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Forget credibility and good taste, surrender to its shocking insanity, and you'll treat yourself to one hysterical coronary of a good time.
If you like slapstick humor you will love this movie, although plot is predictable the stuff they say is rediculously funny!
Good movie to watch with a group of friends. Keeps you laughing
Good movie if you need a big laugh. Some of the scenes are way out there. Worth a look.
this movie is great..luv anna kendrick and zac effron...cute romantic comedy
One of the best comedies of 2016 that takes you on a wild adventure!
Good comedy...exactly what'd you'd expect with the cast
I purchased this as a gift and the recipient said it was a good movie and he would recommend it to his friends.
My wife and I had didn't have much expectations of this movie being very good. However we came out loving it. This disk has very good picture and audio quality.
Great movie, very funny. I love anything with Aubrey Plaza.
Though a bit more vivid than I expected, this movie provided laughter.
This is the first movie in a long time that I felt was too short. While a few scenes fall flat, the actors shine.
You could tell just by the cast that this was going to be funny. And it did not disappoint. I would recommend this to someone having a bad day.
This movie is funny! A must have comedy. Aubrey Plaza steals the show.
A good cast and some very funny moments make it a worthy film to sit down and watch.
Bought this as a gift for family movie night, the story line was a bit predictable but it was so funny that you just went with it.
funny movie, not to much drama. lots of laughs. my wife and i really liked it
The cheesy teen movies have now turned to the cheesy 30 something movies. Not great but worth the watch and could get better the more times you watch it.
Very funny comedy and it's just a good time all around.
Good movie, not as funny and the previews made it seem but it still has a few laughs. Worth getting if it's on sale.
Whoever is in to comedy, they will enjoy watching!
My wife convinced me to purchase this. But it turned out to be funny
Knew nothing about the movie when I got it, enjoyed it thoroughly. I figured slap stick comedy, instead it had a great story line and comic relief.
Pretty funny movie with an enjoyable cast that seem like they're all having fun.
Really funny movie I like anything that is Zac Efron is in
Funny movie a lot better then expected if u enjoy comedy get it
Excellent movie for adults only This is particularly good in the ultra 4K high definition format. Adult humor and content, children not welcome.
Hilarious. Zac effron is a great comedian and the supporting cast is amazing
There is only so many crude jokes and nude scenes any 20 something year-old male can take. And this move exceeded both.
This movie is pretty predictable, but it was fun to watch and pretty entertaining.
But kind of dumb at others. Overall ok, the funny parts outweighed the dumb.
This was a funny movie! I think Zach Efron is a great talent! If you like comedies, this is a no brained!
This movie is hilarious, it is a must watch and you will laugh.
This movie is really funny. Definitely not for kids. This is adult humor all the way. The cast is great, especially Anna Kendrick.
Love this movie no problems........................
Zach Efron and Andy Devine should be in more movies together because they are hilarious in this movie.
This movie is really hilarious. If you love to just laugh and have a fun night, then this is for you.
not too bad. had a few laughs. zach efron and adam devine play well off of each other
I had low hopes for Mike and Dave but when we rented it I decided that I actually quite liked it. Very funny and silly movie. Decided that I needed to purchase it.
Super funny movie would recommend to my friends. A
Hilariously funny. Worth the money. Will watch again.
Silly movie but worth watching. Would recommend seeing it for a good laugh.
It was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend watching it.
The movie was pretty funny, overall a good watch if you like raunchy comedy.
Great romantic comedy. Very funny. If you are looking for one a must buy.
Decent comedy, dragged a bit at times. Got on Black Friday for $10 so good deal for 4k
I was surprised by this. Wedding comedies are usually hit or miss. This was a hit. The actors have great charisma. The plot is predictable, but so fun to watch them get there.
This movie is hilarious. Nice scenes in Hawaii and lots of humor.
The movie was decent and had some great of humor in it. Definitely not kid friendly
Overall pretty good movie, glad I purchased it at a reasonable price.
Not a huge amount of plot but this movie had me laughing enough to watch it twice in one weekend!
Glad I didn't see it in the movies, raunchy at times, loses steam but overall funny and worth watching.
This movie had a talented and hilarious young cast. The movie is based on a true story which seems too crazy to be true, but overall it was very entertaining and will be great to rewatch.
Any fan of outrages and over the top comedy will enjoy this underrated comedy.
Good movie, but not great. I'm not sure how I feel about Zach Efron and comedy.
I liked the movie and the transfer was great. The movie had great sound with good extras.
Wedding troubles is an understatement. What could go wrong when two guys go on craigslist for dates to a wedding? Everything or almost everything. This movie is filled with drama and craziness that will keep you entertained though out.
I enjoyed this comedy and suggest it to anyone needing a laugh.
Funny movie for the most part. The girls steal the show though!
FUNNY MOVIE AND GREAT CONCEPT. YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.
This one seems like a very funny romantic type comedy. Pick it up as a new release at the good sales price. Haven't had a change to view the entire movie yet, but first glance it appears to be just a standard funny comedy. Some will like it and some will not; so far early views it is one I believe to be enjoyable
This was a funny movie. I will enjoy watching it again.
My daughter wanted this movie. She has watched it a few times already so I'd say she's enjoying it
Kinda over the top stupid but that's why i liked it
The 4 stars are great plus a fun supporting cast! Also, Aubrey Plaza is SPICY!!!
Funny movie! Zac Efron and Adam Devine are hilarious as brothers!
My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. Wasn't expecting much, but ended up laughing harder than I imagined. Couldn't wait for it to come out on Blu Ray. Definitely worth it!
Movie was great. Extremely funny! Great actors and story line!
This is a amusing adult comedy with a crude undertone.
Very funny movie, great quality BluRay, a very good purchase
This was great movie with lots of action involved. The price couldnt be better when I bought during the Christmas season.
pretty funny movie. Definitely glad we watched this at home and not at movies. Good quality. Has some laughs. Not quite sure it will be watched again soon but definitely good for a movie night at home
A hilarious raucous movie that keeps you laughing.
I bought this movie as a gift. The recipient found it hilarious.
Purchased this for my son as a stocking stuffer, him and his college buddies loved it!
This movie was really funny. However, some of the scenes were definitely for mature audiences only. Lots of drug references, crude remarks, and bad language.
Overall a good movie, I love main characters but it was kind of predictable for the plot of the movie.
Lots of good happy moments. Better then regular TV
If you pick up this movie make sure you are in the mood for stupid fun. The cast is very likeable and the premise very contrived. Not for young or sensitive viewers.
Not in danger of any awards. Just a fun silly film to watch.
Had a lot of funny parts for up and coming actors.
Another Best Buy Deal. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10. Funny moments with a happy ending.
As this movie was at a decent price, I decided "why not". Didn't see it in movie theaters or anything like that. It was a pleasant surprise.
My family really loved this film. It was much funnier than the previews sounded like it would be.
Funny entertaining a good movie if your of the right age.
Overall a pretty funny movie. Zack Efron didn't play a big part.
Overall was better than expected and a plus that the bloopers are pretty good too!
This movie definitely has some good jokes. I laughed more than not for sure.
A solid comedy that will make you laugh. Maybe not out loud, but it will.
This movie was hilarious. Wasn't sure at first if it was going to be good but I wasn't disappointed
This is a very good and funny movie. Some parts were just plain hilarious.
More my husbands movie but worth watching and adding to our comedy collection for sure
I'm sure this is not the movie for everyone. However I think the cast works well together and created a funny and memorable movie.
The title pretty much explains the movie. Two brothers who have a rather bad habit of ruining big family events like weddings and birthdays are in the doghouse with their parents. While their sister wants them to come to her wedding, she doesn't want them coming alone to try and hit on her bridesmaids. If they can't come with dates, they aren't allowed to come at all. Since they do love their little sister, the overgrown children come up with a plan to find dates that their family would approve of. Unfortunately for them, 2 girls that are as bad as they are learn of the trip and pretend to be the women that would be the perfect fit. From there on, the movie goes through the various adventures of the characters often ending poorly, even while the two dates do their best to avoid being discovered for who they are.It is funny, but some of the humor will be considered in poor taste and there is some nudity so not for the kids. Good for some laughs (and a few groans too).
Movie came as expected and with digital copy to boot!
I really enjoyed this very funny movie that has a pretty good story line and all with it I think just about anyone can enjoy this one.
It is a hilarious movie, based upon a true story ( kind of).
Very funny actully funnier then I expected I will definitely recommend
Another good comedy to watch. Lots of laughs. Perfect for movie night with friends.
All the movies that I bought are very funny and I would definitely suggest anyone that likes to laugh to get.
Nice first date movie. The four main characters work great together.
I love Aubrey Plaza! This movie is so funny you will die laughing!
This movie has it's ups and downs, but Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza make this movie more likable than it should be.
It is not one of his funnier movies. It is more about him finding love. It is okay if you like a little girly love.
This was a great movie. Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza are both hilariously funny actors. Zac Efron and Adam Devine were really funny too.
super fun and funny movie! its a lil hard to believe anna k is a "baddy" but shes still funny playin it... made me laugh, so worth the watch
It was a very funny movie and very unexpected at times.
I love this movie it is hilarious! Aubrey Plaza is the best my fav in the movie! You won't be disappointed if you like the goofy raunchy type movies.
It's funny, I laughed a lot. It reminds me of the American pie series and specifically American Wedding... Basically you have a couple of stifflers for brothers and they get a couple of female stifflers for wedding dates and let the tragedy ensue.
This is a funny movie and we had a few laugh while we watch it. The re-watch value is not very high so probably will not watch it again. But still recommend as a funny movie.
Movie is good and picture looks amazing on 4KReviews were good for this movie and it was funny
Great performance from Adam from Workaholics and Zac Efron.
This movie is funny and at least worth watching if your into comedy's. I'd wait for a sale if you plan on purchasing this though.
Very good and funny movie, makes you laugh so much
Good raunchy humor where the Main characters have no filter!
Very funny. Kept us laughing through the whole movie.
A bit raw at times but a fun party following the characters as they try to take advantage of each other. Decent buddy movie for both sexes.
Good comedy! (Not great, but worth the watch). Not a "family safe" movie.
Seriously one of those stupid, stupid, and stupid but extremely funny movies that you can just sit and laugh at. This is not cinema its just fun.
This movie is very funny and well done. It doesn't hurt that it takes place in Hawaii! Recommend if you are a fan of workaholic.
It was an ok movie. Not the best movie I've watched.
Funny movie but they used a few to many lines used before. Younger generation should have some new quotes to use
These two guys accidently find thier equals in creating mayhem and madness.
Movie was light-hearted and funny! Great movie if you want a good laugh!
It has its moments to give you a laugh. Glad I didn't see in theaters
I didn't think I would like this movie. I was so surprised at how funny it was. Don't expect your life to change after watching this, but do expect a good laugh.
Loved the movie it was halarrious. I've watched it a couple of times
This movie is hilarious! Definitely NSFW or your break!
This is a laugh out loud movie. So many hilarious scenes that are not overly done. Zac is a natural and Adam is the next guy to watch.
I thought this movie was going to suck and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't and it was actually pretty funny.
This was a nice simple comedy that I enjoyed. Fun to watch
Funny movie. Good price. A++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a very funny movie, but it was probably more of a Redbox movies versus buying and owning it.
Like most comedies now a days this movie can be ridiculous at times but its definitely fun to watch. Anna Kendrick is amusing and even in this role adorable. The 4 of them have a fun chemistry between them that makes it easy to watch. Enjoyable movie.
The comedic talents of each of the leads in the movie and their onscreen chemistry make this movie hilarious. Great for fans of Pitch Perfect, Workaholics, and Neighbors
Very funny movie and it comes with a hd video download at a low price.
It's a really great movie I do like it a lot. Recommend
I liked this movie, I liked the price from Best Buy even better.
this movie is not gonna change your life but it has some pretty good raunchy laughs in it.
Funny Movie...Kept my attention the whole way through...
This movie was on my "wish list". I got it on sale at BB for a great price.
Thought that it was a good movie glad i bought it!
I bought this blu ray movie on sale and i gotta say its pretty funny.
I re-purchased this on 4K because its really funny and Anna Kendrick its great in thus movie, really funny
its just a funny movie, the plot is irealistic, but all 4 main actors have great chemistry plus are great in comedy its a must have
Believable escapades by all parties. Ridiculously funny mishaps the entire movie
Excellent movie for adults onlyâ€¦ This is particularly good in the ultra 4K high definition format. Adult humor and content, children not welcome.
great for a dollar but they are salty
This is a great drink. My son drinks it. Just add ice.
good flavor good thirst quencher
good flavor
Too much sugar for me but my kid likes it!
Hawaiian punch is just great any ways I chose this item cause I enjoy the limeade tartness
It good
i buy it for kids at church
These wax strips work better than Nads or Sally Hansen for upper lip waxing and don't irritate my skin as badly. When I would use Nads or Sally Hansen I would have a rash for days but figured that was better than a mustache. These cause me only a little irritation that subsides after a day. I have dark, thick upper lip hair and have to use these every 7-12 days to keep it under control. I'm so used to doing it that it doesn't even hurt anymore. Clean up is easy with the finishing oil. Only takes me about five minutes total to get the job done and the strip removes 95% of hair in one swipe. Then I get the rest with tweezers. One box lasts me about 3 months. I highly recommend these for the upper lip.
Works well, easy to use.
Great movie! Definitely worth the money! I just have one problem- when I recieved my movie, the Digital HD code did not work.
Closed Caption not available. With the actors accents, it was impossible to watch and understand. What I did see/hear, I liked
Entertaining, funny and true to the original movie. Not as romantic as the original but a worthwhile movie night for the entire family.
nice movie . to watch with the family.
I loved it!!!! Windex stock should soar once again. This is the kind of movie I enjoy-light, funny, with excellent actors who really know their craft. There is enough horror, danger, and sadness in this world today. I will be watching this movie over and over. I predict there will be a number 3 Big Fat Greek Wedding movie to showcase the daughter's big day.
I LOVED THE FIRST ONE SO I HAD TO SEE THE SECOND ONE.
Sequels are never as good as the originals, but this one was cute and funny
Loved the first and enjoyed the second. Didn't see it at the movies, so glad it's out on dvd.
I sure hope I can keep up with all of the points I should be receiving.
If you liked the first movie you will love the second movie. All the cast have done a wonderful job making us crack up again.
While not as great as the original, this witty film has plenty of laughs to offer! I just wish they had included more bonus features.
As with most sequels, this one does not rate as high as the first one. However, the focus on family, heritage, and traditions is still strong, and to be admired.
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is one of my favorite romantic comedies, so I had no doubts when the sequel came out in theaters. The romance between Toula and Ian is as beautiful as ever, and the addition of a daughter was a very nice touch.
Funny in a different way from the first movie. Good clean humor.
Watching this movie took us down memory lane. Watch it with old friends!
This was a great addition to the first My Big Fat Hreek Wedding. Would recommend it.
Funny, good for a day when you just need to relax and laugh.
This is a fantastic sequel. If you liked the first movie, you'll like this one.
The price was ok, but not very easy to put on. That's why I only rated it a good.
I did enjoy this follow up film. It's not as funny as the first one. But it continued the story nicely.
Pretty funny..... Family comedy...... Worth watching
I liked that I got the digital version with my purchase cause I can put it on my iPad to watch when ever I want
This is the sequel to My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The first was much more funny, but I liked this as well.
I really enjoyed this movie. It made my day. It made me laugh the people in this movie were funny.
Not as good as the original, still have very funny moments.
Funny but not what we expected. Not as good as the first but ok
story was good ---should have been written after the first
I didn't know if this would be a good watch, but it turned out to be a great movie.
I thought it was in inline with the first one watch and enjoy.
it still gave one good laughs.I love the actors and actresses.
It's a decent movie, but it nothing will beat the original
Really enjoyed the first one so I knew I would enjoy the second!
If you enjoyed the first one, you should certainly enjoy this sequel. I'd say besides a couple select scenes that you can fast forward through, this movie franchise is great to watch with the family!
This is a funny... My husband and I thought it was better than the first
This was a funny movie. It wasn't as good as the 1st one, but pretty funny for a sequel. 4 stars...
Great family movie that makes you laugh and get emotional at some parts of the movie. If you have a family, you can relate to some of it or help you understand what's kids growing up feel like at times. Great to get together with your kids or friends to watch and enjoy.
The lovable, endearing, madcap characters from the original film are all still with us. This is a wonderful follow up, still fun, but it's tough to beat the original film. I still love having it in my collection.
Purchased this for my wife, we watched it together and enjoyed it, but it was not as good as the first movie...
Purchased a copy to share with family and friends.
It was. Funny and enjoyable to watch, I would recommend it to all
They picked the right time to bring back this storyline. The stories were heartwarming and they drew a nice conclusion to a crazy and loving family.
If you liked the first one you will like this one--lots of laughs.
A good comedy movie.it comes with digital hd also. A must see!
It's just a fun story to have the whole cast back together. Blu Ray format not mandatory, but looks great!
very, very good movie I highly recommend this movie for just about everyone to watch
I think the first movie was better but still great movie
If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this one. The first one was better, but this one was worth my time.
Let just say that the wife enjoyed it and thus it was good
Thought it was funnier than the first one. The bathroom scene was a riot!Wished it had more extras. The blooper reel was hysterical!
Its not as good as 1 st, but still enjoyed it. Fun
My wife wanted to see this movie and after watching it I found that it was pretty good for a sequel.
This is a good sequel to the first movie. If you like the first movie it's nice to see how things ended up with the family
Fun, light hearted comedy that makes me want to be Greek for a few days.
Liked it. I still thought the first one was better.
What can be said about sequels that hasn't already been said. A fun follow up to the original and it was great to see the entire cast return.
I liked the first My Big Fat Greek wedding movie and I liked this one also. They show the ups and downs of a close knit family. Funny movie!
Not as good as the first movie but was funny. I would recommend it
This movie is just down right funny . . . just funny?!
Not as good as the first one Buy stilk fin and entertaining
It's a Blu-ray... video and sound were up to par for the 1080P medium. The story was very entertaining... enjoyable. It held it's ground well with the very imaginative original. It made for a fun stay-at-home date night movie with my wife. I don't usually recommend a movie to anyone, but...
Great movie as it was very enjoyable to watch! My wife and I enjoyed!
Wonderful, heartwarming movie. Just as good as part one.
This was a good movie not as good as the first one though.
I ENJOYED "MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING" SO I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS SEQUEL. JUST AS GREAT.
It was a cute movie. About the parents not having been married.
Great movie if you like to laugh. Better than the first movie.
Expecting one thing and got another!! I love how all the characters were still available for this movie!!
I loved the original My Big Fat Greek Wedding and was really looking forward to the sequel. Although it wasn't as funny as the original it was still pretty good. I enjoyed watching it and I would definitely recommend it.
My wife loved it! One of her favorites is the first movie, very entertained
A follow up that did not disappoint. Felt like you needed to have watched the first Greek Wedding movie in order to truly enjoy the comedy of this picture.
Of course have # 1 so had to get the second movie.
I bought this as a gift, so haven't seen the movie, but I heard that it is okay if you are a fan of the first one.
This movie wasn't as good as the original as far as plot goes but I couldn't stop laughing. I am a lot like the character "Ian" in the movie in that I married into a Greek family. Both movies remind me of how it feels to be in this type of family with all the crazy things that go on. Over all, a very funny movie.
Not as good as the first one but nice to see our favorite crazy Greek family years later.
Was pleasantly suprised with this as it was a good 2nd movie.
I enjoyed the sequel to this very funny comical movie
Good sequel with plenty of laughs and includes the original cast.
This was a movie that had most of the cast return. It was great to see what happened after the original. If you liked the first one you will like this one.
It was a good movie with the cast of the first one
Great family movie, funny, sad, happy you name it it's in here.
This movie had the whole laughing all night will watch more than one time.
Very rarely do sequels come out as good as the first, but this one did. I enjoyed this almost as much as the first. Highly recommended for a good laugh.
It was funny, and a good movie, but the first one was better.
My Big Fat Greek wedding 2 was definitely not as good as the first, but few sequels are. It was still a cute, funny movie. I enjoyed it and was glad I finally watched it.
NOT BAD/NEVER AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE,BUT WORTH THE WATCH.
Loved the first one. So I enjoyed the second one also
Not as good as original of course but holds up just as well!
a nice 2nd movie super cute and fun if you like the first one go for it
This is a quaint and entertaining, albeit not especially original, movie.
Since we were highly entertained by the original movie, and that the sequel was comprised with the same actors/actresses, it was a no brainer to buy this DVD. It was nice to see familiar faces and elaborate on what had transpired over the years with everyone. I enjoyed the first movie best, but this one was still entertaining, and can be viewed as a stand-alone.
Not quite as good as the original but good enough .
It was great to see these characters again! Just as funny as the original movie.
this movie was funny and just as good as the first movie these are a must have
The first one was the best, but I still thought it was a good movie.
It's been many years since the first Greek Wedding but the sequel is a must watch for fans of the original.
This sequel came through Most sequels fall short but this film came through with all the characters from the first
Almost as funny as the original. Emphasizes the importance of family, love, and acceptance.
great sequel - typically even numbered are not that good
This is a interesting movie for fans of the original.
I enjoyed the first film and this was good. Nice to see some of the same characters back.
Not as good as the first movie, but lots of laughs. Worth a watch!
Just as funny as the first!! Hoping there will be a third!
Great deal on black Friday, it's a funny movie. The first one is a classic. Totally worth watching l.
Great to see all the actors return to the parts they made great.
I did own the first movie and I must watch the second one after so many years later. The movie is OK.
This was a nice way to continue the story line. I enjoyed this movie.
This one had extra cheese on top of a cheese pizza, but I still laughed, which is the most important aspect of a comedy.
It took a long time to get to an actual sequel. They did have some off handed sequel or something, but this is the definition of a sequel. It was a good continuation of the first one. Having most everyone back was great and it seemed like the chemistry was still there. It was a good movie with many laugh out loud moments. We all need a little Greek in the family.
This sequel is very cute. My 14 year old daughter, my husband, and I all enjoyed watching it together. We laughed a lot.
Not quite as good as the first movie but still pretty entertaining
I really enjoyed this sequel. Thought they did a great job withouy going too overboard. Loved the developments of the characters.
Great comedy about a family growing and the troubles they face.
This was a great follow-up to the original. A really fun movie.
It is a good movie but not as good as the first one. Guess the biggest thing is who gets married.
Great part 2. It was hilarious and made one thankful for family.
A good sequel. Not equal to the first, but still good.
Bought this for a Christmas gift. Funny and enjoyed watching
I literally wore the disc out watching it so many time. But that tend to happen with me when I love watching so much.
My mom really liked the first movie (I also enjoyed watching the first) so I got this as a gift for her. She enjoyed this movie too.
It's not the first one by any stretch, but it was fun though.
We loved the original movie and thought we would give this one a try. It was good, but not as good as the original. We would still recommend watching it though.
Shipping was free and arrived within 2 days! I believe this movie will be enjoyable to recipient.
If you liked the first one.. the 2nd movie won't disappoint.
if you enjoyed the first movie you will like the second. light entertainment and an enjoyable flick
This movie is funny and fairly clean. It is not as good as the first, in my opinion.
While not a good as the first one. it is still fun to watch. I love all the hart warming quirks from this family.
Would have been nice to find the original movie to watch prior to this one.
Plenty of laughs for your enjoyment. Great follow up movie from the first one.
This 2nd Greek wedding isn't as great is the 1st one but It still was a fun movie to watch.
You won't go wrong owning this classic, funny movie. Loved both 1 and 2! Enjoy!
A follow up to the first movie. If you didn't watch the first you won't understand the jokes qin the second.
Once we got a movie that worked ,things were great. First 3 did not play. Do not know what the problem was.
These characters feel like you know them because they remind you of your own family. The movie was a fun glimpse at real life.
the person it was bought for had the vhs and realy wanted to up grade to be able to watch it easier
this is a sequal movie its not as funny as the first but it is still heartwarming and fun to watch. the characters are the same
I liked this movie but it was not as good as the first one.
I loved the movie! It is different enough from the first movie yet similar enough to understand the meaning.
It was a good movie but not as good as the first one.
I'm not into chick flicks. This is one of the few I can watch and enjoy.
Ever since I watched the first one I wished they would do a sequel just to see what happens after. Glad they did even if they waited so long to do it
My wife loved the first so had to get the second. This one seemed to go to dvd quickly, but it was worth the purchase, very funny! More of the Greek antics like the first. Part two is like a continuation of the first, funny.
Worthwhile sequel after waiting so long. Was glad to see the original cast return after so many years. For many people this chaotic and dramatic family is quite reminiscent of their own family. Lots of laughs interspersed and entertaining.
good sequel to original movie - recommended to all
It was a cute movie and built upon the comedy established during the first. If you liked the first movie then you will really enjoy this one. All the original characters were back and it was a lot of fun.
I went into this movie not expecting much but thought if I enjoyed it as much as the last one, it would be worth my time. I wasn't disappointed. While much of the movie was anticipated, it was like visiting old friends.
A fun and enjoyable continuation of the story with the same crazy family dynamic.
Funny Sequel to the First! Nice to see returning Cast members!
The wife loves this movieShe has watched over four times already
With so much time having passed, it's hard to believe a sequel like this would even be tolerable, much less good. But it is pretty good, in fact. It doesn't repeat too many old jokes, and that's for the better. The only moment that's truly cringe worthy is the moment where the entire family is out jogging to "We Are Family." Ugh! Beyond that, I liked the movie very much. Like the first, it's a great romantic getaway for you and the significant other.
fun and entertaining movie. a must watch with the family
Cute movie like the first. They kept the original Dancing Zorbas!!
I went into this expecting that it would not be as good as the first... and it's not, but it was better than expected.
It was a good movie. It really was a good sequel and held true to the first
If you love the first movie, then you'll love part 2! Like that the cast is back and the quirkiness of the family, makes this film fun!
Christmas gift I have not watched yet . But do plan to
This was a good follow up sequel to the first movie
Looked forward to the follow up movie. Great to see all the main characters back. A fun movie.
The laughs keep coming! If you enjoyed the first one you'll enjoy part 2.
I would have thought that a sequel would never be as good as the Original but I was mistaken. You will love the movie
Fun for the whole family. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie
Funny movie a great addition to the first movie. Recommend seeing Big Fat Greek Wedding 2st
Not as good as the first, but still a great movie. They brought back the main cast and still got the same laughs. If you liked the first, you will enjoy this one as well.
There were some very funny moments in this film. An enjoyable sequel.
Great movie that continues the story. Very funny as the first one was.
Most of the original actors returned for the sequel. Stayed true to the original.
If you enjoyed the first film, you will love the sequel. Great film about family and inter-generational cultural challenges.
Great movie , just as good as the first movie, saw it when it came out and could not wait to buy it.
I loved the first movie, so of course I had to see the 2nd movie. It's not as good as the first, but it still had laughs and a good movie to watch.
I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh !! What a family.
Very funny movie. Sequel to the first, but really enjoyed the original better!
This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my son, he thinks its a good movie. Good price, great shipping
It has been working well without any problem. Also it's very quiet. It has a auto-shut off feature when it reaches to the temperature. Auto-shut off comes with both good and bad. I use it in my office when it gets too cold. Since it automatically shuts-off, I'm afraid I might forget to turn it off when I leave my work. Besides it, it has been working well.
i have been using this heater all winter (so far about 3 months) and it negates my need to run the hvac system all the time. i have a 1300 sq ft two story townhome and i keep it on the down stairs level, this fan forced heater keeps it comfortable and keeps the chill away.
I bought this heater to replace one in our cold bathroom. It works well but my wife says it's loud. It is quite small but the price is right and it is super easy to use. I purchased this specific heater because of the review in Consumer Reports and I agree with their evaluation.
I enjoy this purchase, especially for the price. It works quickly, but just a tad on the loud side. It is still work the money.
the script are one of my fave bands and i really enjoy this album. the previous album was better but this one is very good as well. "no good in goodbye" is a great track
Nice record for a relatively new band. On par with their previous output.
I love that best buy still carries albums. Script is awesome
I love the Script, this isn't their best work but it is good enough. I'm glad I bought it
Just got this one still pretty fresh to me yet, but it is growing on me. There is a few songs that I know and like. Others I don't but so far not to bad.
The CD has nice sounding music on it if thats what you in to
Saw The Script over the summer with One Republic and they were awesome.
loved these for my snacking will be getting more will get other flavors
Very solid. I like this with salsa as well.
I have been using the product for two weeks and I like the way I can smell the conditioner right when I open the bottle. It feels soft in my hands. I like the way you don't need a lot to cover a lot of hair. It easily works into your hair leaving a nice sent and soft hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I really like how my hair feels after using this conditioner, with the shampoo. It seems resilient and strong. I will recommend to my sisters, for sure! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I find the scent a bit too strong. Thanks for the opportunity! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
As with the shampoo, the conditioner starts with a nice light scent, but has a strong chemical smell which stays until my hair is dry. The conditioner rinses out nicely, with no heavy oil feel, and my hair is clean and light! I like the way my hair feels! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I think the Pantene Expert Pro-V Agedefy Conditioner is great on aging hair. I found my hair was softer, had more shine and bounce to it. I would definitely use this product again and advise any of my friends to try it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I like this product. My hair is moisturized and healthy after using this condioner not limp and lifeless like some conditioners can do to my hair. The conditioner smells great and works great! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I think this product is awesome. My hair is shiny, light and soft. The smell of the conditioner is very nice too. My hair is not as frizzy either. Thanks for letting me try this amazing product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Loved this product. it left my hair feeling and smelling great! Most conditioners leave my hair feeling greasy, this one didn't at all. will definitely buy this product in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The AgeDefy conditionner is great ! The product is pretty thick and moisturizes very well. It leaves the hair feeling silky smooth. My hair appeared to be shinny and healthy afterwards. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been using the conditioner for 3 weeks now and love it more than when I started. It is thick and creamy, has a wonderful smell and makes my hair feel silky and smooth. My hair shines and the grey pops. It is amazing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product is innovative too. This is the first time I tried age defy conditionner. My hair is silky and not dry. I am really amazed by the quality. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I like the Age Defying products and will use it again. I do not see a 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner and hope they will have it soon. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
On my first try with both the shampoo and conditioner I notice that my hair is less dull so my natural curls are falling softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product left my hair a little frizzy but I used my straightner and it took most of it out along with some Argon oil This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This conditioner is great a little goes a long way and doesn't leave my hair heavy and oily! A must try!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been using the AgeDefy conditioner for about a week with the matching shampoo. I love the scent of this line and really enjoy the light perfume smell that is left on my hair afterwards. It's not overpowering and very feminine. I like the texture of the conditioner. It feels hydrating without being too heavy and hasn't left my hair feeling frizzy or dry. On the other end up haven't felt like my hair gets greasy quickly or is weighed down so it seems like a well balanced conditioner. I have long fine curly hair and this condioner worked very well for me. I will still supplement with a weekly hair mask, but it leaves my hair supple for the whole week.

I have only been using Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner for a week, but I have already seen results. I have very fine hair so conditioners have always made me nervous. They often leave my hair looking rather limp and dull. Once I tried this (small amount) I was hooked. It's a nice thick consistency that seems to stick on the hair without seeping to the roots and causing that limpness I often found with other products. It rinses out nicely and leaves you with tangle free hair. I love the smell of the conditioner. It is a light fresh scent, nothing overpowering, which was a nice surprise. Overall, I am very happy with this product and would buy it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I tried out the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner from their Expert line for about 2 weeks. I have fine, wavy hair with a dry scalp and split ends. I found that the conditioner did a really good job of helping with my dry scalp and giving my hair more volume. I also found my hair to be smoother and softer. The product is also a very nice consistency and has a neutral scent. The only issue I had with this product is that after using it, my hair became greasy much faster than normal and I have had to wash it much more frequently. As I all ready have dry hair and split ends, this isn't the greatest but otherwise it is a good product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Some people choose Botox for their face to make them feel young again, some choose transplants, I choose Pantene Age Defying Conditioner to make my hair look and feel younger! It leaves my hair strong and shiny. No greasy oily feeling with the conditioner, nice and creamy and clean feeling. smells good too! My hair feels clean and hydrated. I was having issues with my hair falling out and it looked as though my hair was the new carpet for the shower floor, now my hair is nice and thick and on my head! definitely suggesting this to my friends!

I received my bzz kit with my Pantene age defy conditioner and shampoo to try! I found the conditioner to be nice, rich and creamy. It smells nice but not my favourite of scents because I'm not a huge fan of the smell of coconuts. It detangled my curly hair easily. After I blowed my hair I did notice that I had less fly away hairs and less frizz! I also noticed it tammed down my grey hairs, and my hair felt silky smooth! I am pleased with this Pantene age defy shampoo and conditioner and would by it if the price is responsible! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I loved the scent of this product as soon as I opened the box. The packaging and formula looked and felt professional, like a higher-end salon product. Even the weird brown colour of product lead me to believe maybe there was some sort of colour or anti-aging ingredients in it, but probably just a marketing decision to not alter it or to make it look like it contained Olay. Both the shampoo and conditioner were very moisturizing. They made my hair a bit on the limp side, but it air dried and blow dried very nicely. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I tried the AgeDefy conditioner and was actually pretty impressed with how smooth and soft it makes my hair feel in comparision to what I was using. I have been using for over a week now and it seems to be also helping maintain my colour. I have noticed however that my hair is very fly-away over the past few days difficult to know if its just the return of cold air or the conditioner. Will have to keep an eye on it. I do really like that this product is thick and stays on the hair when applied in the shower. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Wow so glad I got the chance to try and review this conditioner, I have had a chance now for the last week to use the conditioner with the corresponding shampoo and I must say I love it. The look of the bottle is appealing, the conditioner smells great and my hair feels so soft. My hair hasn't felt as greasy towards the end of the day if that makes sense to everyone. I am looking forward to how many more benefits I will see in the coming weeks using the rest of my bottle up, this is definitely a product I will continue to buy This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love the way that this product feels on my hair in the shower. It rinses really well too. I found that it works/looks best if you blow dry your hair it doesn't look as 'fresh' if you let it air dry. I have had a lot of people comment on how good my hair looks. It is a challenge to keep your hair looking good when you don't use any styling agents outside of shampoo and conditioner. My husband has also commented on how much fuller my hair looked with this product. After all, who doesn't like a compliment This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I really liked this product! I've been having problems with tangles in my hair and conditioner not properly coming out of my hair in the shower. I have to say this product solved both of these problems. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to protect or even repair their hair. It leaves your hair soft and manageable!

I have been using this conditioner for a few weeks. Nice conditioner, smells good. It's difficult to say if this conditioner is any better or worse than any other conditioner. It is decent, but I cannot say that I have noticed any difference in my hair since using it. I have long colour treated thick, naturally curly hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Thanks to BZZ agent Jono for sending me the shampoo and conditioner. This conditioner made my hair smell divine, but I wouldn't recommend for anyone with curly perm. Also gave this to my friend who has straight hair and she loved the look and feel of her hair after using this product for the last 2 weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I really liked the conditioner for the smell and how it went on. It helped to squeeze out my hair thoroughly first as I found it a bit thin on my very thick hair, but as long as I used enough, I found that it was great for making my hair look healthy and lustrous and also tangle-free!

I have been using the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner for a couple of week on my short white hair. Never been able to use other conditioner because it's too heavy for my hair and usually end up with flat hair NOT WITH THIS ONE. I like the way my hair feels with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Hello, I have used Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner together with the sampoo and i think that they are working great . My damaged and dry hair who is and very frisky also have changed , after 4 utilisations, his aspect, it looks healthier and stronger. I am very curios if in time the hair will look younger and maybe stronger. I think you have to use both of the products to have real results. I realy like both of them, They have a really richness that makes you use them daily . This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Conditioner left my hair shiny and smelling great. It spread through my hair and detangled quite well. It rinsed out and did not leave any residue behind. My hair air dried with no frizziness and when blow dried it was smooth and glossy. I liked the thick texture. I would recommend this conditioner for people with thicker or coarse hair like mine. I really liked trying this conditioner. GotItFree Pantene This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I used the shampoo of course the next step is condition :-) The Pro-V Agedefy conditioner has a nice smell the formula didn't weigh my hair down at all as some conditioners can do. I don't tend to use conditioner everytime I shampoo as I have very fine hair some conditioners can create a build up. The Agedefy did not seem to do this at all left my hair bouncy with volume. Would I buy this after using it A resounding yes! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been using this conditioner for the past 2 weeks thanks to Bzzagent. I only used it after using the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo. This is a great conditioner! The hair is so easily brushed after the use, it's great! And it doesn't tangled easily for the following days so I like that. I only pass my fingers in my hair to apply the conditioner, let it sits for a bit and then comb my hair and I have no knots! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The Pantene Age-Defy Conditioner worked well with the shampoo of the same name. I have dry, brittle grey hair and the conditioning made if feel quite a bit softer. I liked the thickness of the conditioner, it did not run down your face/head while leaving it on which is nice. The scent is nice but a bit strong. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, grey hair. You will like the shiny, soft results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I think this is a very good conditioner. It comes out of the tube like a rich, creamy moisturizer and smells fantastic. I have been using Pantene products for years, but I have used this conditioner for about two weeks. For starters it is way thicker and more luxurious than other conditioners. Some conditioners are watery and runny. it lathers up really well and then washes out completely without leaving any residue that can weigh hair down. My biggest issues are aging hair, including unruly greys, lackluster dyed hair and dry hair. My hair is also naturally wavy and can get really frizzy, especially in the dry, cold Canadian winters. This conditioner addresses all these issues. My hair is soft and manageable and feels moisturized and well nourished. My scalp is not dry or itchy. My hair has a lot of bounce and movement in it. It is bright and shiny and healthy. It is now more like my 19 year old daughter's hair. I like this product and will continue to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I've been using this product for about a month, and it does live up to some of its claims. One thing that stands out in particular is the fact that it tamed my grays. It didn't do anything miraculous, like prevent those suckers from growing in the first place, but it did keep the wiry hairs from sticking up like a beacon of my impending old age. Another surprising quality was that it detailed my hair nicely. A brush would just glide through, even when wet. Finally, as a girl who only washes her hair 2 to 3 times a week, this conditioner kept it from getting too oily too soon. Unfortunately it did dry out my scalp, or perhaps that was the shampoo's fault. I would not repurchase this product as it contains too many ingredients that I can't pronounce, however, I will keep what's left in the bottle and use it once a monthwhen my hair needs extra detangling, or when those nasty gray hairs pop up and need a little taming.

I reviewed Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner through BzzAgent, these opinions are my own. Following on the heels of another hair product that left my hair quite dry, I was a bit nervous that this too would leave my hair wanting but I was pleasantly surprised. The shampoo seems to be really gentle and fortifying and the conditioner adds new moisture and shine with lots of body to boot. The scent is pleasant and light and not noticeable in my scent free workplace. I believe that this product can Defy age as well as the environment, heated hair appliances and all the rough stuff that life throws at our hair. Additionally, I found that while using Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner, my usually mischievous and unruly hair, really behaved nicely, it seemed calmer, more relaxed. This is a product that I will certainly continue to use and recommend to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
About 18 months ago my hair started to look damage. I had never given much thought to my hair. I had never had problems with it. I thought the damage was due to stress and my hair dresser agreed. I have tried so many different products during this last year and 1/2 with nothing helping. After starting to use Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner I have really noticed a change. Now when I feel my hair it feels silky and doesn't feel brittle. Before I was afraid to brush it or blow dry it too much, now I can't wait to style it and show it off!! Can't say enough about the change in my hair since changing to the AgeDefy Conditioner!! Thanks Pantene! GotItFree This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I ordered my jar online and it just arrived today. As I was excited to taste it I opened it right away. Upon looking inside, I see the oil completely separated from everything. I know this can happen to nut butters, but this also says NO STIR on the label. I had to completely remove the nut butter from the jar and place it inside a bigger glass bowl and really work the oil back into the very dry nut stuff. Which then made me look at the expiration date, it expires on Sept.15,17 so within 3 months. I do not know how many months out the company puts a label when it is processed. So, maybe that is why it separated the way it did Now, if you don't mind having to re-stir your almond butter back up to the right consistency this stuff does taste REALLY REALLY GOOD!!! I would repurchase it again and hopefully it would have a further out expiration date. I wish i took photos, but I didn't.
Bought this cuz the store was out of Justin's sticking with it cuz the price(I'm not made of money)! Says it's no stir, but mine had half an inch of oil on top and definitely needed to be stirred! May have been an older bottle, cuz I've never bought it before, so once the next one comes in I'll revise my review if necessary. Great flavor over all, love it on an everything bagel.
the first time I bought almond butter it had honey in it. the next time I went into buy some all there was, was maple. to this day I have never seen honey almond butter in any store and I've checked them all. bring back the honey.
Good flavor.
Would buy again
Great Flavor This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Very chocolaty taste to them. It hits the sweet tooth. Light snack not heavy eating. It does not taste like a brownie.
I love the taste of these they are a wonderful snack to have I don't like to many things either they are two sweet or not sweet enough but these are just perfect I just wish it was easier to find them in stores I have had to buy them online because none of my Walmart stores have them.
They actually were pretty good. I would buy again. Very sweet!
Has a brownie-like flavor. Tasty. I have a sweet tooth and the Cookies n' Cream was much richer!
I remember when these DVDs were so expensive... Now it was so economical I was able to close out that Series in my collection.
Good show, not much into mafia stuff but entertaining
Fantastic deal to catch up on everything. Just disappointed with the ending.
We have purchased all of the previous seasons and enjoyed watching them. We knew we would enjoy this season as well! Can't wait to purchase the last season, Season 6 Part II.
Great price to close out my Sopranos' DVD collection.
I have had dry frizzy hair for 30 years and tried many products that have failed. Before I tried this, I was using Tresemme's Smooth Silky sham/cond plus applying 3x the recommended amount of a leave in salon super skinny serum. It was the best I could find, but on some days it just frizzed and looked bad. Then I tried this product and was immediately impressed with performance. My hair was smooth and soft and very manageable. I finally have the soft, healthy looking straight hair I have always wnted. When I put my hair into a ponytail it looks a lot smoother than before. The odor of this product is difficult to deal with the first few days. It smells like cheap hairspray or cheap cologne trying to cover up an even worse smell.. The first time I used it my teenage daughter asked me to crack the window of the car so she didn't have to smell it. But over time we got used to it. I shampoo almost daily and I am now on my 4th bottle of each, shampoo and conditioner, and have consistently had great results. (I still use the super skinny serum).
I have thick hair, and I do like the conditioner, but I need one that will control frizzy hair all day long. It works better than most conditioners I've tried, but I still have fly-away hair. I will continue to look for a conditioner that keeps the fly-away hair smooth all day long.
It makes my nearly unmanageable hair smooth and soft.
love it
good
My curls were always crazy and all over the place with frizz... when it was humid out my hair would grow but not in a good way. It would grow up and out! Since using this new product my hair has not done that as much. I have to say I am very pleased with my hair. It smells nice and is soft and manageable. I do not have to spend 20-30 minutes trying to 'tame' my hair any more or just pull it back into a pony tail...it already looks good thanks to TRESemme's Keratin Shampoo and Conditioning line.
I've used this product for a few months and I love it! Though I still do have very frizzy hair. It helps keep my hair smooth, which I love. I only use the conditioner, and not the shampoo so that may be the problem with the frizz. I'm so happy with Tresemme that I'm thinking of purchasing their serum. Hopefully using the conditioner + serum will help with the frizz. I recommend this product to people with unmanageable hair, and to people who straighten their hair.
I bought this condition because I wanted my dry hair to feel soft. This conditioner did exactly that. I also use the shampoo with it. Leave the condition in your hair for at least 3 minutes and then wash with cool water after shampooing..You will see great results :) these products also smell fantastic and make your hair smell fantastic
The product is great but it leaked during shipping so it was a mess in the bag that also contained the shampoo that did not leak
okey dokey, worked the first time I tried it for re-charging phone, have not tried the ac outlet as yet but I am sure it will be okay, they were out of stock at the store, (crabtree mall, Raleigh) so I ordered on line 10 days till I received it.
I use this in an industrial setting and it works great. I would recommend this product to anybody that needs an item like this.
This deodorant does work well it keeps your under arms very dry, and that says a lot when you live in the south during the summer.
I Know it's not good for the ozone but it's the only anti-persperant that works for me
The only thing we ever use. EFFECTIVE.
I'm would recommend this Eagle Brand Borden Sweetened Condensed Milk Fat Free, as a good substitute to the original, but the original tastes better, in my opinion. Thanks for reading!
We love using eagle brands for our fruit salads
I started drinking Canada Dry ginger ale from watching the TV show Everybody Loves Raymond. Now I'm on the diet version. The taste is pretty much the same, that's the good thing. But there is a large dose of sodium in every can: 120mg of sodium per 12 fl oz can. That's 3 times as much as Coke Zero, which is 40mg per 12 fl oz. I have to knock a star off because of this. If Canada Dry can drop the sodium down to Coke Zero level, that would make it perfect!
I love the diet ginger ale and have been buying it for many years. Recently, the 2 liter bottle has some kind of defect in it. The bottom center of the bottle is longer than the bottom sides of the bottle, forcing the bottle to teeter and lean to all sides, eventually leading to a tip over. Needless to say, I will NO longer buy this size bottle and I will look for a replacement brand to take it's place. And no, I do not want to buy other size bottles as the 2 liter is the best value for the money. CHANGE YOUR BOTTLE!

I enjoy a Diet Ginger Ale on occasion. I was reading the label and noticed that my bottle says Made with Real Ginger. There is nothing in the list of ingredients that says Ginger. I like the product but think the label is misleading.

There's never enough of the soda on the shelf it seems that when I go to purchase it there always are down to one or two cases. It doesn't have a bad aftertaste considering that it's diet.
I love the refreshing taste. Don't really like to drink dark diet sodas
Baxter's Cream Pomade claims to be a light hold/soft finish product. It really doesn't feel like a pomade at all. To me, it's just a thick cream that probably could have been put in a squeeze tube.For me, I find the best way to use hair products is to layer them. So I would 1) work in this soft creme, or a comparable workable pomade 2) add a thickening agent like a hard creme and 3) finish with something that gives a firm hold.Also, not a huge believer in the less is more rule when it comes to hair products. I prefer a good finger full evenly worked throughout. Same for this product. I mean I don't goop it on, but using a dime-size isn't enough.Since all hair is different and the styles desired by people too, hair products can be very subjective in how they are rated. That caveat aside, if your hair is short and you do use product, then I'd bet this soft cream could find a home in your hair product selection. It will put your hair into a workable, flexible mode that is ready for shaping in any way you want. I wouldn't use it on it's own because the hold factor isn't there for the style I wear. It just makes the hair maneuverable enough to style the way I want, and then I use something else to lock that style in place. If you were going for a natural comb to one side look, this might be all you need thought. As a closing note, the glass jar this stuff comes in is really cool. Price is a bit high, but it is good stuff.I would use the product again.
Was never a fan of pomade--never really knew how to make it work and still look good on me. I read about this product in an on-line article and thought what the heck, try it. It has not been a bad product. I like it better than other pomades I have purchased in the past from salons.
Baxter's Cream Pomade is a nice, clean hair product that incorporates well on your strands and keeps things looking soft and natural through the course of a day. I have short-medium mens hair and I prefer to keep my style looking clean-cut, masculine and unfussy and this product manages to keep things in line by providing some added volume and a subtle, moisturized finish.The compact 2 ounce jar is handy when traveling and since a small dab is all I need I expect it to last at least 3 months with near daily use. The cream gets kudos for those who like to keep things low maintenance as it easily applies to your hair, washes out with no hassle and has no perfumed scent worth mention.
It's not bad, but could be a little more garlicky.
Creamy and tasty.
pretty good in a pinch, usually make my own, but will probably use it again
Good for casarole
this is a very cheap option if you need just a minimum security
This window/door alarm is effective and easy to use. The chime and alarm features are both appropriately loud and will immediately gain one's attention. Installation is easy IF your door is flush with its surrounding framing. If not, you will need to figure out a way to make the alarm and the sensor even with each other. Overall, this is a good, inexpensive alarm.
Will be using them for organizing food service files
This is a novel product that can be utilized for a variety of organizational projects. I particularly like that the bottom is closed, even though that can limit the amount of documents that will fit in each subdivision. I LOVE being able to create tabs within a single file folder. Bravo! On the downside, I think that the tab alignment makes it difficult to fit a proper, readable label on the large folder tab. Overall, though, a great idea and a solid product.
I use these files for meeting pkts. I can easily seperate the documents, try to label them accordingly and send it along with my boss so he can find his documents easily. I also find it great for separating department documents. I do love using this folder!
I used this product to organize my cake business. Orders, receipts, supplies.
Divide-it-Up is a great product for organization freaks like me! Would be useful in both home and office applications. Would have liked to have a printable tab label sheet with software to label the tabs. (Hate to write on the tabs or look for and buy label sheets. Otherwise a great product! Would buy again and would recomend.
I am always trying to organize with file folders by color coding, this takes it a step further by having multiple pockets within one folder. I can't say they're durable or flimsy they're file folders and they feel like such. Be great if they were maybe a little thicker but it is what it is. Yes, they're going to get dinged up here and there and documents inside will have a bit of damage but to me, that's expected when you're dealing with things made of paper. I just wish they were more colors!
I use this product for my executive's travel folders. He does not need an intensive travel folder so these are great for him. I was glad to see the assorted colors as an option I am now able to assign a color for different trip categories. I think the color folders are more durable than the manilla folders.
It's an organized to do list with room for backup information
These are great for organizing materials for my coursework and helping me sort materials for my portfolio project.
Used for school Very Functional and Organizational I would like better colors than prime blue, red, yellow. -- boring. Pastels are more pleasent to look at, teal, purple, emerals.. possibly glossy would be nice too.
I'm so excited to have one folder do more than one thing for me. This is going to change my systems!!!
This is great for jobs that have a lot of parts...receipts, notes, contracts, inventory sheets, invoicing, etc.
We plan on using these for our homeschool classroom. They will be very useful in organizing my 5th graders work. I'd prefer them to be a bit more thick considering they will hold a greater load. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product!
It is an effient way to organize multi level office organization. I wish there was a better way to store in a file cabinet though because it seems to be best used vertically but it will do the job.
Item to be used for meeting organization of agenda, sign in sheet and othe information. Allows easy access to items without clips or other seperaters.
This product it great to keep organized I just wish it was a bit more strudy.
Using this product to get some job files in order. Product seems to be well made .I think it will hold up to daily use.
This product is excellent for filing multiple papers dealing in one subject. There are tabs to separate 4 separate files in one folder. I can take one folder and still manage all my documents. I can file under one heading and still know where to find anything related to that subject in a orderly way. I think the paper weight could be a little heavier because of the amount of paper that can be filed but that would not stop me from using this useful product.
I use the folders to categorize related task, subjects or projects that are in progress.
As a teacher, I'm always trying to find a better way to organize the many subjects that I teach. It will be easier to organize copies needed for a unit of study. Any chance of making a 6-tabbed folder Would be great for those math unit.
This version is sturdier than the previous product and with colors it maked organizing papers easy and fun. The tabs are a bit uneven though and could be better finished
Great way for me to organize while going to and from the office. Keeps my portable inbox sorted by category. Only wish the individual tabs could hold a little more.
Great for organizing house paperwork and dividing up accordingly in the smaller pockets
As a grad student, I stash one of these in my laptop bag for collecting class handouts throughout the day. They're great for simple, immediate sorting, but have two shortcomings: 1) they don't hold all that many papers in each individual section 2) the manila folder material isn't as thick as an ordinary manila folder Otherwise, a nice invention. I wish office stores sold them individually! Tim
It's not exactly for me personal wise, but for businesses that need to organize a few different categories in the same folders, it's fantastic!
I love these file folders!!! They make it so much easier to organize my filing cabinet. My only complaint is the fact that it is easy to bend and ruin the tabs. I wish that just those parts could be made of a sturdier material or at least be reinforced in some way.
I am using these folders to organize the Science and Social Studies units that I teach. It is working really well.
As a teacher and family bookkeeper I love well-designed filing materials and the Divide It Up folder as a welcome addition. The original product was too flimsy so the decision to upgrade the cardstock weight is a big plus. I'd still like to see it in a light polyvinyl and, even better, in many colors(currently there are 3-5)- but if the cardstock makes it more affordable then they've got a winner here. I'm filing everything in it because the built-in dividers let it function like a mini-binder.
I had already purchased these in the plain color and I was excited to have the bright colors. I love these folders!
This product was helpful for keeping track of various samples and information received for a project. I had everything all together in one regular file folder, but now I have sorted the information and it is much easier to work with without being bulky.
This is great for things that you have alot of but need to seperate into smaller categories, like medical bills or expenses.. I can pull a file and find things in no time at all because its all right there but easy to find at my fingertips!
I actually like these for personal and business. I use them for our automobile files at home. You can then separate purchase papers, service receipts, etc. AT work, I like them for the expense accts. and the back up receipts etc. required. I especially like that they are available in colors for ease of account identification. They are best for small quantity rather than large., however.
I have wanted this product for a long time. I often have project files that require different information kept together, now I can easily access and keep information seperated within one file.
I am remodeling a condo and must constantly carry my notebook containing orders and receipts. The divide-it-up works because nothing can fall out of the bottom of the folder, but it would be even better if punched for a 3-ring binder. I need several folders at a time, and that would make it easier.
This is a great folder for keeping projects organized and keeping all the papers/forms for each project organized in one place.
Really like this product. Helps organize the file much better.
I like the design of Divide-It-Up folders. I wish they were made from sturdier, stiffer paper.
I ordered a pack of these folders, after receiving my sample package from you, to use for my boss's meeting folders where he has multiple handouts. I like the idea of separate pockets. Could be better constructed noticed that the pockets tend to tear easily.
I use these folders at home for organizing recipes I want to try. I can easily locate separate categories instead of hunting through a larger pile. The folder could be a little sturdier.
a little flimsy, and divider pockets could be a little deeper, but a GREAT space saving idea for sub-categories (eg, month...date).
I like the fact that instead of one folder with multiple pages on a topic, I can sort the categories of the topic, each with its own section and label, within the general folder. It should be easier to find specific pages without sorting all the pages in the general folder.
use for billing Keeping reciepts in order and invoices in order
Will be using for my coupons, wish it was a bit stronger.
Great organization folder, just needs to be a little stronger.
I bought for personal use but may use for business. Would like the pockets to be a bit deeper, but I had a lot of stuff for that month. But i liked the design and it works pretty well.
Just perfect for assembling like items - lab reports, diagnosis, insurance.... Finally Medical by Body Part! -- Feet, Type 2, Dental, Lasik -- and in a common folder. Great help for itemized IRS.
I usse it to keep my circulars and it's just great to have them all (4) in one folder.
useful for keeping related files together but would like to be able to keep larger amount of paper in it
I use this to keep my monthly receipts. Works great!!
I can keep everything together regarding one project and have it organized and easy to find in only one folder, not ten.
I use this to prepare for meetings where I need to have multiple reports without the bulk of a binder. I also use this to separate articles on the same topic as I organize research materials for discussion. Since it is sealed on two sides, my papers don't slide out of the folder.
This is great to organize items within a single file. Would like to see it be made sturdier and also in other colors.
Use for travel docs for the boss, training packets, routing multiple docs to group of management Would like to see it in different colors, more sturdy material, a designated place to put a label on the top cover
I received these as a Power Member and used them for a meeting I attended in my first time as the secretary. I was able to use one for correspondence and another for notes. The individual sections really helped me to find items with ease as opposed to searching through a folder looking for items. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the paper was a bit sturdier.
Love this! So much nicer than using paper clips to divide up items in a folder.
I am transitioning from full time employee to full time mom and this was great for the transition period of training my replacements.
I use these folders both personally and business wise. I organize the jobs I do with specs, pictures, quotes and such and personally I organize my bills and such.
I use these folders all the time! Class papers, Home Organizing, Kids papers, Everything. The inside dividers are the perfect concept. I would add that they need to be more durable,they tear easily and more color choices for ease in organizing.
This came in handy to organize multiple bank statements for accounts that have check books but not alot of statements.. however the thickness of the folder could be improved upon.
This design is well thought, and comes in handy! It is great for someone that needs to organize a wider array of things in one file.
As soon as I saw it I knew it would help with my upcoming trip to Montreal. I'm always looking for ways to organize and this will defintely help. I've already told others about the product.
I will order this product to help keep myself and my materials better organized. With three areas within the folder, it's easy to find, sort and keep on task. Would like to see this offered in colors too.
Would be even better if it was available in colors (I like color-coding) and made in a poly material to be durable and long-lasting
easy to use. I like that it's an addition to something I already use all of the time. One improvement would be that the tabs stick out farther, hard to read when regular sized papers are in folder.
I really like this folder. The one thing I would change is the stock currently, it's too thin.
Recipes...low fat, low calorie, low carb.. Travel... agenda...hotels...flights Workshop...information...notes....books to read Things to do....urgent...in a week Trip....receipts...information...brochures Project....receipts.....information....brochures Stocks to buy....information... different recommendations... different
I really liked the concept of this folder, I just wish that the separation dividers were graduated from top to bottom so when you put the same size papers (8x11) in them you could see the different sections above the previous ones. The way it is layed out, things are divided but they are all at the same level and not as easy to access. They are so much better than the normal file folders, though, because you can keep things in it when you tip it to the side.
I really like the concept of four related items in a folder. Convenient and quick. I will buy more.
Useful for documents of different sizes or types such as receipts, account information, recipes, project ideas, etc. Each section can hold letter size paper if organizing by type. Bottom section is 4 tall so small or short items can be separated from full sized items to organize multi-sized items. All sections are open on only two sides which helps prevent items from falling out. Bottom section can be taped to next section to make a pocket to really hold items inside the folder. Main tab is 5 wide for long single line description and about 1/2 lower are inner tabs which are 2 wide. Also each section itself has room for labels, notes, or even attached items in addition to tab space. These are not heavy weight paper but adhesive labels on tabs will make them sturdier. Sections won't hold high volume of pages but pages can be placed on top of the sections for higher volume (same fold lines as standard folder). To use these inside a standard folder, cut off main tab to add flexibility to existing file folders.
Used for personal use. It is a little flimsy but will still purchase more of them.
Love the concept. Interesting idea and very useable in the workplace. Great way to keep a project scope, timeline, task list, and agendas all together.
I am using multiple folders together. Therefore, I would like to see this product with tabs 2 thru 4 turned to a landscape format allowing me to visually see and retrieve the information I need much quicker.
I bought the product for personal use but find it very useful in my business. I hoped to hole punch it to use in a binder but the size it too large or I would have to cut it down to fit.
I use it for my students papers and my small business
As a real estate broker, I appreciate the ease in which I can keep the various documents of a transaction together. Sometimes we have various stages of a deal -- rather than paper clips I can use the dividers within the folder.
As a teacher these files are terrific because they enable you to sort documents easily but the construction needs to be sturdier, definitely some kind of vinyl. I'd love to see this file done in the same material as the Pocketfiles product. I'd buy oodles of them and change my filing system. Hint-hint!
When on the road I have customer info that is easily available. I am not fumbling through a stack of paper.
I am a Consultant and these help. A reminder, these help you to organize, they are paper and not miracle workers. They are excellent for their value and purpose. Anything other than that then you need to pay for a personal assistant.
I use the product to keep related papers together in one place. I can keep meeting agenda, minutes, receipts, and to do list, in one folder. GREAT!! I would like the paper used to make the product heavier for more wear and tear as the product is very excellent for multiple use.
I have used this product to organize materials for my students in centers or station activities. It is nice to be able to put directions, worksheets required, and manipulative materials together in one packet to hand out to students so everything is right there. The price at which I purchased this package will allow that they are inexpensive enough that I can have one per stuent. I do wonder how long they will last with some students though and would wish the material be more substantial. It would be helpful as well if there were a flap type pocket in the smallest division, as we use many small items when working. Right now I use an envelope to hold the small items which does work well.
I love anything to enhance my organizational skills and this product adds even more organization to my files and Ideas. I can create a Main Category and then add Sub-division or additional pieces of documents etc and keep everything in one file. I wish they were made in Poly or some type of Plastic. As much as I will utilize these Divide-it-Up Folders I feel they will wear them out quickly and have to purchase replacements.
As a teacher, I use it to organize sets of photocopies for class use, labeling the tabs with the title of the handout. It's a tad confusing to locate the right tab for the right section of the Divide-It-Up. However, the price is great, and that's VERY important to me. Please keep making these. (Also, one of my adult students fell in love with it and uses it to organize his own handouts.)
Great for my small construction company. Each smaller job only needs one folder and everything can be organized within that one folder. The only downside is that everyone has the back of the top tab glued to the back of the folder and rips when you pull it apart.
This file is great. It organizes you completely!! I just wish that the right side would be sealed so that the little things (like receipts) won't fall out!!
As someone who provides many of the materials students use in the classroom, this is an affordable way to keep them, the room, and myself organized through multiple projects. A variety of colors would allow for further organization through color-coding systems.
I love the option to organize multiple topics in one file. However, the file seems very line and I would think that it would wear quickly over time.
I have many print-outs of articles pertaining to diverse issues, and can mix files to arrange the information as I feel it pertains: for example,billing and shipping info can be filed with product or source info.for better cross reference
It is going to eliminate the use of several folders for one topic/company. Great for sales receipts,menus,school letters,etc
I'm always worried that smaller pieces of paper will drop out while i'm walking down the hall for signatures or presentations. I end up clutching the folder pretty tight. Keeps receipts safe and organized too when traveling.
Should enable me to keep my classroom teaching materials much better organized and will cut down on the number of individual file folders I need to carry.
Uses are endless...from organizing travel, to events, to financial statements. Love this file.
Keeps my work divided and enjoy that all in one folder. I'd recommend it!
As a Project Manager, I need file folders which allow for quick access of various types of documents including those related to processes, personnel and tools. This folder allows me to grab one file for each type of meeting, rather than trying to find the right documents from numerous folders. Because the folders come in various colors, I can coordinate them to Project Management processes or specific team assignments.
Pockets make easier access to categories of documents for organization and presentation. More efficient than multiple file folders.
Organization of all documents related to individual projects or quizzes, Would prefer sturdier construction, Would prefer dividers to be attached at fold instead of document bottom for ease of labeling,
Many times there are multiple components to a repetitive task. I use these folders to break it down and organize the main points. Also terrific for monthly to do that only get used once a year. Nothing falls out and I don't have to spend time searching within the file for important parts.
This file system helps a great deal to organize different papers that belong together for a single event or presentation. The manilla sheets are very thin and I worry that it may not hold up to transportation in a briefcase day in and day out.
great way to keep files organized. Different colours help as well.
I have projects that have different phases but did not want to set up files that would only have 1 or 2 sheets of paper in them. The Multi-Section file folders are a great solution for me.
I use this product for both personal and business use.
great to divide different job tasks and bills that are paid and to be paid
Great that these come in multicolor packs. Some papers may need to be folded to fit certain tabs which may not work in some situations. Otherwise, great everyday folders. Also great for filing small pieces like receipts or stubs.
I used this product to organize my income tax information. It was perfect for the types of paperwork I needed to separate and archive.
Would like the last tab (the one on the very back) to be higher so it is more visible when the cover is closed (currently the tab is partially covered by the next tab down).
I plan to use it to organize bills/pd receipts before data entry and filing. Also plan to use it for various tax forms and notations/record keeping.
my files are almost in the same size, so files overlap each other. it doesnt look as perfect as on the ads
I like these file folders because I can contain related and similar documents, but keep them sorted, organized and separate within the same folder. Easy to grab the right paper and simple to put it back in the right spot. Classic everything has a place, and everything in its place design.
I use it for keeping track of Medical bills and other house expenses.
These folders are good for meeting prep and for organizing loose papers that need to be sorted.
Terrific idea for multipart projects and activities that have a variety of media and/or documents that aren't standard sized. Can better organize and visualize materials and tasks.
Looks like a nice answer to organize presentation papers
You don't lose all those little pieces of paper when you put them in these files
I use them to coordinate projects and have everything in one place
Small receipts are easy to locate and can be sorted by type
I needed something that allowed me to categorize papers within a file folder without adding too much bulk to the file itself. I feel this is going to help me keep my paperwork so much more organized and accessible.
I use them to keep various projects organized, including meeting notes, emails, and documents. I used to use the divided folders (with the prongs on top) since those withstand most wear and tear, I don't know how well it will hold up to frequent use considering the weight of paper stock used. I suggest something more durable or coated tabs/edges. I've had to tape one folder up (at the crease) already.
The Divide-it-Up is great when you have paperwork that have sub-categories. I need all the help I can get when it comes to organizing. I use it for organizing receipts. The four sections help me to organize right down to the smallest things. The colors give me another option for organizational style. Divide-it-Up is a reflection of the fact that Pendaflex is the leader in innovative tools for organizing.
I organize my files my clients by color. I need more colors and a large number of units per package.
Am using these to keep documents/receipts for taxes so it's perfect for that use. Would not be good for anyone needing to bring or carry folders in briefcase as construction is same as simple file folder tabs would be destroyed too easily. Would love to see different colors just for cosmetic reasons, unless they are available just not at the store i went to. Otherwise I love them
So useful and easy to use. I love being able to put stuff in one folder, but yet divided at the same time.
I wish the 3 sub-pockets held more than a few pieces of paper they get stuffed quickly. Nice that the overall folder has scores to extend it - wish the sub-folders did too. I was hoping to use this to organized complex client projects, but the capacity is too small. Probably best for sorting receipts and other small papers. You probably need to be quite organized to use this effectively. Recommended with reservtions.
Great space saver can use in place of 3 file folders. I like being able to organize within a single folder. I wish it came in more colors to color code subjects. I wish it was wide enough to punch holes so I could use it in a binder.
I had to arrange groups of legal documents (will, power of attorney, medical directive, etc.) in a convenient folder that kept everything together and organized. This was perfect! Now I've started to use them at work to manage different projects.
I organize my businesses by color. More colors would be appreciated.
Great for organizing your bills, less folders are need. Easy access to your bills all at one time.
I keep meeting notes and pieces in these and they are good for that, but not sturdy enough for long-term archiving.
This is a great idea, and they still work well, but the dividers are very flimsy (like thin paper)inside the folder, and they so not go all the way to the bottom of the folder.
The folder is very helpful in seperating various documents used per one specific training session. I am able to view the tabs which usually is a problem with individual file folders.
I have over 250 patients that I take care of, and I need to be able to find specific documents at a moments notice. These allow me to organize all of my patient information so I can pull what I need when I need it. LOVE this product! Sometimes the glue sticks and its hard to open the folders seperately. I do not label the individual little folders, because I know what goes in each one. The tabs are a little short so it's kind of hard to write boldly. But that is really my only cons to this product!
I manage documents for my father, his household, his Trust, and myself. The color coding, multiple sections help me quickly sort locate info.
Looking forward to organizing my papers in a new way.
I label the folder and add the files. Which allows me to be better organized. I would buy even more folders if they had more sections.
I like the tabs so different sections of a project can be sectioned out, much like a 3 ring binder, but much less bulky. But worth noting: the longest tab at the top is really the over all file folder label, and does not have a specific pocket attached to it. Overall many uses for this product. Would like more colors to chose from.
I needed a system to help me manage multiple items for different projects or meetings. I am able to create a folder for each particular project so it's organized in my bag. It's not as bulky as an organizer or binder and I am able to sort documents according to purpose much easier. I wish it could expand a little more to hold a larger amount of paper.
Would like to see shortest tab sealed so small recipets willnot fall out
It's great that these can keep different sizes of paper organized and easy to read. I'll use it to keep up with my 2013 Medical filing for tax purposes.
The folder organizes my documents in the order they come in.
We were able to keep forms separated for presentation and made it easy to pull them for handout.
I got these folders to keep track of my monthly spending. I used to have a file box that i would divide the smaller receipts up and put in envelopes within my folders. With these folders I can separate the receipts without the use of extra envelopes. My only complaints about these folders are the color choices are pretty boring and the dividing tabs are not full length. The first pocket is handy, the second level is great but when you get to the third tab it does not reach to the bottom of the folder, so papers can get lost in my use of the product. I still use the folder but if it was changed it would make me happier.
Picked these up in hopes of better organizing my home office. The 4 tabs per folder has come in really handy and proved really useful. I've used classification folders in the past, but the pressboard construction while sturdier made the folders a bit cumbersome and well, sort of overkill for what I needed. For everyday use these new files are definitely a bargain in comparison and the construction has actually held up well.
I like that you can divide more than one file into a single folder with the separations
This is a great product for client files! You can separate critical paperwork by year, and make it easily audit-ready. I like that the inner tabs are still visible even with full sized sheets in each pocket.
I use these folders to set up travel for my Executives. It's convenient to be able to break the trips in segements and have a pocket for each!!
Just bought these and started re-organizing my filing cabinet. The Divide-It-Up folders are replacing my previous system of hanging file folders stuffed with file folder subsections and freeing up a ton of space! I don't feel like contents are going to spill out when I pull out a file although I do wish the exterior folder itself was a little thicker. Also, more colors would be helpful.
I'm going to use these in addition to both standard files, and the computer.
I am a teacher, and I use a folder to organize all the paperwork I need for the day. I can separate papers needed for each class, and those needed for meetings.
File folders have typically felt lacking in effectiveness of organization, and, more specifically, typical file folders fail in sub-organization. These inner-tiered, divided file folders subdivide one folder into three easily labelled sections, offering much more usefulness than simply putting a pile of papers in a stack stuck in one single folder.
I can see myself using these for my home use as well as at work. I love that there are pockets and the papers you put in the folders will be secure. I only wish they were made with a little bit heavier paper.
LOVE this product!! Wish it came in all the rainbox colors for even better organization. :)
I found the folders very useful. I have my own business, work outside the home in multiple locations and have my own personal/home filing/paperwork. I love that I can organize it and that the stuff isn't falling out of the files. Cannot comment on durability since I have not been using them very long.
Using Divide-It-Up allows you to see what is actually in the file by just opening the folder and looking at it. You don't have to shuffle through all the papers in the folder to find what you're looking for. I just started using these folders and I believe Divide-It-Up will help everyone our the office.
I am using them to separate different documents pertaining to individual on site locations for things such as completed, pending, need to be done.
practical and can contained sorted documents in one folder
No where on the package does it state half of the folders have the main tab on the left and half on the right. I needed twice as many packages to get what I needed all to the left. What a waste. I would not have bought had I known they were not all the same. Otherwise these are perfect for complex projects that need items together but separated out. Could use more colors, like green.
Using to organize Mothers bills/insurance/car/house/etc.
This product is great for organizing materials needed for lessons. I also like it to prioritize my to do list.
This product will be used for income tax organization, forms and receipts.
I travel for business and need multiple files at my fingertips all of the time. Several files of this type will fit my purpose very well because I won't have to be sorting through papers or paperclipped items.
I have been doing this myself, cutting down files to sub organize!
Up until today, I didn't realize this product existed... And that's really too bad. Bought these on a whim during checkout and I am thoroughly pleased. I do a lot of papercraft, as well as creative writing, and I've always wished for a folder-ish system where I could organize various documents, templates and various bric-a-brac for a project, especially one that could handle a variety of different sized pieces that will, eventually, constitute a whole. This fits the bill - now, instead of just throwing all the various pieces, of vastly differing sizes and shapes, for a papercraft project in a stack with a binder clip, I can logically lay them out in the product's sub-folders. YES!!! While I am overall very pleased with the product, a few pieces of constructive criticism presented themselves while I was familiarizing myself with these new folders: 1) The covers feel very flimsy when compared with the side of the folder with the pockets. Because of the extra layers on the pocket side, it is much beefier, and, sometimes when I pick a full folder up, the cover pops open and documents can slide out. 2) It would be great to have a few different interior layouts of the product - sometimes when working with a lot of small pieces, seeing as how they would lend themselves to the lowest, smallest pocket, get jumbled up and confused. having a few different pocket layouts could help remedy this. 3) It would be great if the folders came in other dimensions, besides just the standard 8.5x11 size. I work with a lot of over-sized pieces of posterboard and it would be really nice to have folders to help organize them as well. A smaller, pocket-sized version would be very useful as well. 4) This final one is purely cosmetic - the folders come in only three colors. For project management purposes, having seven or eight (or more) different colors would help me keep the folders organized one color per project. Overall, I am very pleased with the product, and, if the need arises, I would absolutely purchase more packs.
Provides a great way to organize things. We use these folders to keep track of various piano competitions and performance opportunities for our daughter.
There are so many different things these folders can be used for. I like to be organized, and this product just takes it one step further!
I use these folders to orgainze mulit-year contracts with multiple vendors. This allows me to also split various vendors' paperwork in one file.
Looking forward to having things in ONE file , but being able to divide that individual file!!
Use these do separate class assignments! I'm a teacher and I also use them to separate categories like already graded and to be graded! Also to separate different classes.
Works extremely well to organize expenses, presentations and separating hand out materials.
This product will better help me keep track of receipts.
This product allows me to keep my daily tasks organized in one folder. Perfect for organizing multiple due dates on projects!
I use these files for contracts. the divider sections are handy to seperate areas. budgets, contract, vendor information, etc.
This type of file is handy for receipts and small documents. I'm using one for a trip on which I don't want to loose any little things I'll need to submit later.
#NAME?
Allows me to have all of my schools documents in one place but seperated at the same time.
I am a teacher and it is important for me to keep track of student's work and confidential files. I used to have to put folders inside of folders to keep things organized. These file folders eliminate most of that double stacking. Also, it is much eaiser for me to locate important documents and work samples to present at parent meetings. Since the pockets/dividers don't allow for a great amount of work, I will use more than one within a larger or expanding file.
i am very impressed with the features of this new product.
use it for review of policies, ie, current policy in one file, draft in the next, final version in third file.
This product is great for keeping critical project details and to-do's all in one place
I'm an EA, and this product is very useful in creating a tidy little itinerary package I can give to my CEO when they are traveling, at a conference, etc. Also helpful at helping me keep track of different types of receipts and Q1-Q4 docs. (although an additional pocket would be more useful in this.) Drawback is the lightweight construction.
It truly helps divide the contents of a folder and highlight smaller integral contents...
Easy to keep different topic documents for same organization/meeting in one place.
I tape a monthly calendar to the front of each folder, and then file bills due by due date first--short bills in first pocket larger bills in second pocket--both with due dates visible by first due, next due, etc. The last pocket is where I file the bills that I have paid. This is an excellent product for the price--One of the greatest things is that Pendaflex includes 12 files instead of 10. This is truly innovative filing and has made my day (year)!
Great concept, mostly realized. Expected final divider to be short, but to run to bottom of file folder. The length means short docs fall into 2nd pocket
Used for organizing billing, and client information
this is great for not only keeping items together but organized and seperated within the same folder
I was looking for an Annual Budget Planner System and I am going to use this EXCELLENT IDEA instead, so I can divide into the packet how will I distribute my money: First large packet will be for my Mortgage, Association Fees, and utilities. Second Packet: Food and medicine receipts, Gasoline, Medical and Dental Services and Day Care: Third Packet: Monthly Goals (home improvement, large expenses like furniture, repairs, etc. savings) and to store my payroll stubs and bank statements. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! it came in a package of 12 so is perfect to organize my entire 2013!!!, the only think that I am not really happy about is the fact that doesn't come with labels and dont sale as individual items...I would be happy to buy an extra one or two just to add my resolutions list to start my year and the other one for my taxes and to organize my goals to be achieved with my returns. Also, I think it will be a great idea to see them on at least another package of 12 but on different colors for other proyects and ideas around the house, for example: to save and divide recipes, to save appliances warranties and manuals, etc. PERFECT ORGANIZER AND GREAT BARGAIN!!!!!!
Easy to use Great for Work or Home use Great way to seperate content within a section Colors help maintain different subjects Great value for 12-folders
I like the concept, i wish they came in larger amounts. i would also love to see these in 5x7 size
I think this is great, I appreciate the innovation. Didn't realize you could make a basic folder better and more useful.
I can take one folder to meetings and I can easily find what I need. No longer shuffling through stacks of paper in one folder to find what I am looking for. It is makes me look organized and not bulky
I was very excited to see this product, as I use file folders quite often to organize events and classes often. This is amazing because instead of paper clipping common items, I can use a separate tab. The labeling is misleading, as yes, there are 4 tabs, but only 3 sections to divide items into. The 4th tab is really to identify the project/application
I love being able to organize different receipts and invoices in the same file for the same month, it makes bookkeeping for a small business and personal records much easier and convenient.
I use this product in my classroom to have the student information available at my fingertips and I don't have to go looking through different binders. I really do like this product and even bought the manila color in a 24 pack.
I use the product to keep all of my printed travel documents in one place. It's great for keeping printed itineraries, boarding passes, receipts and short notes in one place. No need to wait for a smart phone to upload, these items are immediately available using the Divide-It-Up folders.
Working in a job that requires great organization skills, this is a great tool that goes beyond a file folder. To be able to separate various documents within 1 file folder is very beneficial.
A laminated version would be awesome I prefer a single-color pack
Keep receipts and other various sized document together conveniently.
I use these folders to separate my study materials for work and my forms for my second job. They fit the ticket perfectly!
Perfect for a companion tackle box for the truck or hiking to your favorite pond.
I was glad to find this model! I have lower back problems and cannot use most vacuums. This one is perfect!
I use this vacuum every day. Have carpet mostly. Picks up cat hair great. The only thing negative about this product is that it is very noisy. Other wise a great vacuum and I love the canister, very light weight and easy to use.
I use on my carpets, stairs and furniture. I like that it is light weight but I realy miss the retractable power cord. The part of vacuuming I dislike the most is winding up the power cord.
Only have about two weeks but love everything about it. Lighweight and you feel the powerful suction. The separate hand held with attachments is a major plus. Would recommend
I purchased this vac and love the power. The cord seems longer than any other vac I've had. I can only wait and see how long the suction will last........hopefully for years.
We bought this vacuum because it was lightweight thinking that it would be easier to push on our thick carpet. It is not. It is even worse than our current vacuum. That being said if you have normal height carpet or a Berber...something that is not an inch thick it works great! It has amazing suction.
Just received the Hoover Playinum Upright with the canister vac a few weeks ago to replace a 12 year old Hoover. So far it seems like a good buy for the discounted price of 208 online. Not sure it would be worth the 299 in-store price. My wife likes both, so only time will tell about the quality.
This upright vaccum does all it claims to do. The only downfall to the upright is it does not have an ajustable leveler for shag then floor. I love the light on when bag is full. However, the canister vaccum does not have this feature. However, it does pick up well on my hard surfaces.
Extremely light (great for ease-of-use for our children), which is why it doesn't need to be self-propelled, unlike our prior, extremely heavy Hoover vacuum. Nice bright light effectively lightens the area being vacuumed. We've only had it a couple weeks, but we we really like it so far.
This Hoover Platinum is perfect for a large busy household. The canister is so easy to carry on shoulder and the upright is great for rugs and carpet ! my running joke with my husband is that Hoover is the one vacuum I can count on to really Suck HaHa
My wife has gone through 3 of these models and all worked great until about a year or two after purchase, that is when trouble starts and its always the same thing. Inside the handle is a modular connector with four pins that attach to another connector which bring electric to the motor. Every time our vacuums failed due to one of the pins showing burnt or melted plastic either from bad connection or overheating. By the time this happens your on your own so either buy another or pick some other model. I wish Hoover would have looked into this when this model first came out to market.
This is a GREAT vacuum! I've used it now for almost a year. Great suction, really lightweight without losing power! No parts have broken, no repair problems at all. In general, a really good vacuum.HOWEVER, I replaced my plush carpeting with the new Frieze, and now am looking for a new vacuum since this vacuum is VERY HARD to push on this new style of carpeting. If you have this type of carpeting, consider another model. If not, it will do a nice job for you. Keep in mind also, no onboard tools. Must use the companion portable vac. Bags are hard to find for both, must order either from Hoover, or you can get a great price on , so that's no big deal, but plan ahead -)Overall, unless you have the semi-shag Frieze carpeting, it is wonderful!
Did a lot of research online and with Consumer Reports and decided to go with this vac, mainly because if it's good ratings but also because it was lightweight. Haven't used the included canister vac yet but I'm sure it's helpful for stairs. Upright is very simple to operate/push. My only complaint is the Q-type vac bags you need to use for the upright are really difficult to find. The WalMart site showed a different vac bag along side of it when I purchased, so I got those, only to realize once I read the instructions, that they take Q-type. Had to order online at Amazon. Can't find any stores that sell them. I just stocked up. Overall it seems like a good vac and wasn't overly expensive. WalMart def had the best price on this model.
The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner. I used to have a Dyson Animal, and while not needing bags was nice, it was all but impossible to not get a cloud of dust when emptying it. Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson.
When we first bought our hoover we really loved it. It really lifted up our carpet and made it look like new again! I bought this hoover Windtunnel Model U6465-900 years ago and it blows dust out when I vacuumed. Now the smell of dust is bothering me. When I took it into be service they didn't fix this problem. This has a bag and two filters. One of them is a 6- stage micro filtration filter. My question is.... Because my vacuum is out of warranty, does any one know if hoover came out with a vacuum that doesn't blow out dust and smell like dust when you turn on the vacuum Because how well it lifts my carpet and makes it look good, I would buy a hoover if they fixed this problem. I need to replace the brush, filters and bag, so I need to make up my mind up on keeping it or buying a new one.
After consulting Consumer Reports, I originally bought the U6485900 (I previously mistakenly put this review on that model) for the self-propel feature (to replace my U5753-960 that I bought in 2007 and still works great but is too heavy to push around -27 lbs) but the power button and self- propel buttons got stuck the first day I used it so I returned it for this one. I've used it only twice but it's lighweight and powerful. I could do without the automatic height adjuster since my carpet is old and uneven so it seizes up somewhat over the uneven areas making it hard to push. The shiny attachments keep falling off when I use the small cannister so I use my older ones. But since it was such a good price on Walmart.com-188 and Consumer Reports listed the retail price as 400 I figure I got a good deal.
I purchased this product based on two things. I wanted to get away from bagless and I wanted to buy a quality vac. I was so tired of vaccuming up a huge pile of junk and then having to empty it out and then clean out the filter. I think all the dirt that I had just sucked up went right back into the air and into my house! I know that bags cost money but it does not compare to the frustration I feel when I am emptying a bagless. There weren't that many bagged vaccums to choose from in the stores but I am positive that I made the right choice. The Hoover did cost more than I had planned to spend but, I got the quality I hoped for. My carpets looked fantastic after just one cleaning! The sleek old-school style and windtunnel purring of the motor was another plus. You get what you pay for, right.
My housekeeper is very happy with both units. I'm not so happy using it on my VERY high cut pile 8 x 12 area rug. I have a difficult time moving the vac and find that I have to drag it rather than moving it backwards and forwards. On the lower setting it handles smaller area rugs very well. The cannister unit works well on all my wooden shutters, wood walls, popcorn ceilings, and fan blades. Not so good on the upholstery. Short of using duct tape, the wand and accessories don't stay together well. I have been unable to find filters in any retail store however, just found them on this site. They are fairly pricey however, I have no resident family and my dog doesn't shed so they have lasted quite a long time. If I had it to do over, I'd have kept my old upright that self propelled!
Like the vacuum's light weight. It does the job well and not too noisy. Both units have bags which is really nice so the stuff doesn't get air borned when u empty it.
I would have given it a 5-star except I wish it had manual height adjustment. We have a thick sheer-cut carpet and it makes a 5-line marking pattern when vacuuming.
I have had this vacuum for 3 months now. I do home daycare and have a yellow lab so I vacuum daily. I'm really happy to have such a light weight vacuum now. My old vacuum weighed 21 lbs! I don't miss the onboard accessories because I don't use those daily. I really like the small accessory vacuum that comes with it for those occasional jobs. There are 3 things I dislike with this vacuum. (1) The smell! It has that hot, dog fur smell and had that right from the start. (2) No dirt sensor light. I loved that feature on my old vacuum, however, my husband and sons are very happy to vacuum without waiting for a light to tell them when they are done. (3) The suction is too strong, even on low, to vacuum my throw rugs. Overall, it does a great job without the extra weight!
I have had this vacuum for over two years. I like to wait to review a product until I have used it for a period of time. This vacuum is lightweight and easy to bring up and down stairs, can be lifted to do a quick job on stairs, is powerful with great suction and pretty easy to maneuver. It is a bit noisy, but not much more than any other vacuum. The bags are easy to change and last for a long time. It is so lightweight I even use it to vacuum the seats of furniture (getting rid of cat hair). Durable, efficient and well worth the money! The canister vacuum that came with the unit is very noisy and OK for hard surfaces and corners. However I find that the edge suction on the upright does a great job so I only have to concentrate on the corners about once a month.
We've gone through numerous vacuums and all seem to have some type of downside. The Hoover Platinum UH30010COM seems to have the best blend of features and value that we have experienced. The two vacuum design (one standup and one portable) is a great convenience and optimization of features. This allows the upright to be very light (at 11 lbs it is almost 50 lighter than most uprights). The portable is very convenient for tight spaces and especially the stairs. My wife used to dangerously use the hose attachment from our old upright on the stairs. Also I believe the bagged design is superior to a bagless design. The bag is huge and provides a much cleaner sanitary disposal of collected dust and carpet fibers. The one drawback is that the upright can be hard to push on densely packed carpet. To be fair, many vacuums have the same issue. Our Eureka vacuum is impossible to push. This Hoover is difficult to push on some of our carpets but is still acceptable. If it wasn't for this we would give it a 5 star rating.
I had this vacuum for 10 years but the handle finally snapped. The handle grip will also deteriorate over time and will turn from a comfy rubber grip into a skin tag like grip. Yeah... I know. Gross right. The bags on this vacuum are of very high quality and will last you ages before you have to change them. Each of them lasted me about 2 years. I also love that this vacuum has a serpentine style belt so you will basically never have to change it. This vacuum will not work very well on shag or dense/thick carpet but it is great for medium to low pile carpet which most homes have. The canister vacuum in this combo is dinkey and basically pointless. do yourself a favor and go get the hoover envy hush also so you can use the attachments and bare floor nozzle on that. Overall I think that this is a product that you should consider but the orecks on Amazon right now are a good deal. Please do your research and don't waste your money. Have a good day.
I've owned this hoover for almost three months and use it every few days. It looks great. Set up was easy. The upright is very light. Love that. I can vacuum the whole house and not feel tired. It cleans quite well on carpet, but fairly well on hardwood. It picks up most stuff on hardwood, but it does tend to send some hard dirt flying across the room (and that is on the low setting). It is quite noisy, but i dont mind that too much. The bags are pretty big. I still have not had to replace the one i got with the hoover. BUT the bags are difficult to find and quite expensive. I tried to buy from the hoover website but they were always out of stock. i dont understand how the manufacturers can be out of stock for months. The canister has very good suction. Noisy but thats ok. It is a little awkward to use, and to store. You have to wind the cord around the canister and just let the hose lie next to it. No place to put the attachments, so you have to store that separately, which is annoying bcoz you have to go and get it every time you want to change attachments. But basically, both the upright and canister are good vacuums.
This is a great combo vacuum set except that the upright is one of the loudest vacuums that I have ever used. The canister works well but sometimes the attachments easily fall off even though you think they are on tight.
So happy to have found a decent vacuum with bags that provides good suction for cleaning my carpets without throwing dust particles and pet hair back into the air! As an allergy sufferer, "bagless" vacuums defeat the purpose of cleaning my house. I am very pleased with this piece of equipment, and look forward to a clean house and using less tissues this allergy season!
The vacuum cleaner itself seems to be amazing. It got dog hair right up off my oriental rug that I couldn't seem to get clean with my previous vacuum cleaner. The little hand held vacuum cleaner worked great to begin, with but the suction has diminished when I put in a new bag.
LIght weight and very nice to use and powerful and the canister is nice too
opened it today and the reason for purchase was 1 it comes with two vacums one specifically needed for stairs and 2 the other for my wife so she doesnt have to dragg our number one vaccum 'the boss' made by eurika with smartvac up and down everytime she needs to vacum. i only used it for a dry run today she and i love how light it is and it has a ton of power and leaves great lines in our new carpet, the hand held and shoulder strap for the other works great for stairs, also very light and easy for my wife, only one setting for air speed for the hand held, the standup has two air speed settings which i beleive the lower one irs for tile or wood so it doesnt blow dirt away,the stand up is great for stairs also it only ways a few pounds and has extra handles so u can hold it side ways and use it o stairs,and its a good lookin vacnegetives as for now neither vacum has auto roll up for cords and the cords are short 15 feet to ill probly have to buy an extension cord so she doesnt have to keep oveing the plug, the stair vac doesnt have a rotating brush like a normal vac but it works, i can see using this vac in a car and getting corners easier put it over shoulder and go to townoverall it was a house warming gift but it was purchased for 332 and with a 10 percent discount the standup performs just as good as our boos vac only draw bak it doesnt have ajustments for heght of vac for the different carpet if u have diff carpet it might not work for u need the adjustment but overall im happy with it its perfect for what we are asking out of it and we took car3e of 2 birds with one stone
good value. canister is fine for steps and small areas
Purchased based on good review from Consumer Reports. Overall very pleased with performance of upright vacuum. Powerful headlight, full bag indicator, high/low speed, but self-adjusting head digs deep into thick-pile carpeting making vacuuming a real workout. I'm not kidding! I sweat! Easier to pull than to push. At least the vacuum automatically turns off if stalled for too long.Slightly difficult to lift if vacuuming stairs for example, as handle for second hand is located underneath the bag, rather than on top of it.No "quick release" for the cord. So you have to unwrap the cord one loop at a time. Cord exits the upright near the top of the handle, but would be better if it came out as high as it could. I'm constantly holding the cord as I vacuum and at least I don't have to reach that far down for it. Cord is of a good length. I only have to plug it in twice to clean the entire house.Less experience with the canister. Noisy, as others have noted, and container for dirt is somewhat small. It's more like a large, plug-in Dust Buster. But I like the idea of a separate unit. No extra hoses or tools on upright.
This vacuum was purchased to replace another Hoover vacuum that was falling apart due to poor construction. This is a vast improvement over that model. It was easy to assemble, is light weight and has great suction. However, it is VERY NOISY.
Very good vacuum. After going through 1 vacuum every 18 mos, we decided to go to a simple design (less to break). The gimmicke vacuums seem to be cheaply made, and lose suction after 6 mos or so.
I've used this vacuum for the last month and it has been great. I'm used to bagless vacuums so having the bag is a nice treat - since I don't have to see the dirt all over again. It is a one pass vacuum and goes from carpets to bare floors without having to press any switches. The on/off switch is in a great location and the one 'switch' it has it to switch from low to high suction. I've never used the low function and I'm not really sure why it's there.The separate canister is pretty good. It doesn't have as much suction as the upright but it gets the job done. Being able to put it on your shoulder and walk around the house (with the extra long cord) has been great. I do have two issues with this though; first, I miss having the ability to use the attachments during the course of my vacuuming as it is a whole separate appliance. With this, I'm less likely to do a complete job because once I'm done with vacuuming, I just want to be done. Second, the storage of it is awkward. It doesn't fit within itself at all.
I purchased this vacuum as a trial for my housekeeping staff. They love it and fight over who gets to use this vacuum. It is lightweight, yet powerful enough to clean up fine beach sand. The small canister vacuum was a welcome bonus.
The upright vacuum is great - lightweight, great headlight, works fantastic on carpet and moderately so on hardwood and tile floors, not too loud. No real complaints there.The canister vacuum also has great suction, but there are a few drawbacks: it's noisy like you wouldn't believe, the connection for the hose to the body of the canister vac is flaky and doesn't always keep the hose "locked" in place, there's no bag full indicator light as in the upright, and the exhaust ports could blow other material around if the unit is left on the floor. Be sure to wear hearing protection (I'm serious about this) when using the canister vac for any length of time.
The Hoover is a good mid-priced vacuum. It's great on carpets. It does not pick up as much on hardwood floors. The best part is the portable Hoover that comes with the unit. You can walk around with it and vacuum the sofa, cobwebs on the wall, the car interior, etc. It has an attached hose, so it is more versatile than most of the portable "mini vacs". I assembled both vacuums and had them running in only ten minutes or so.
Had another brand upright as we have 60% carpeting, and always had a backache when done due to difficulty of turning, pulling and getting up and down stairs. With the Hoover Platinum, it is light weight, turns easily, and picks up dog hair well. Plus the canister is perfect for vacuuming stairs and my car. If you put the carrying strap over your head and shoulder it stays pretty well and is not heavy. My only complaint is that the extra long cord on the upright gets in the way.
I have had some great "wind tunnel" and bagless vacuums, however they get clogged up and stop working right with in a year or two. I have always had vacuums similar to this one at my store. So we decided to buy this one. I am very pleased.
This vacuum offers lightweight portability and decent suction. However, I prefer onboard attachments like my old Wind Tunnel had. The separate cannister vac is nice and portable, but it lacks the suction of the full size machin.
In spite of having lots of suction, unit is poor at "edge" cleaning. This replaces a very heavy upright, so the lighter weight is a big plus. There is no height adjustment for carpeting, so is difficult to use on shag. On shag one must raise the unit to move forward and pull back across carpet.Pushing unit forward on shag Very difficult. The canister works very well.Lots of power.
Have only used these vacuums for a short time, but both seem to work very well. I like having the smalll portable one and the regular upright. I've only used one attachment so far, it did the job.
This seems to be the answer to my problems. Hard woods downstairs, carpet upstairs, and carpeted stairs in-between. Having two units makes it easy to swap among floor types. and the shoulder canister is easy to use on stairs. All I need is a light to tell me when bags get full.
Good vacuum for money. Very lightweight. It is kind of noisy, and could use a height adjustment setting.
Bought the vacuum because of weight of our previous one...was very difficult for my wife to carry it upstairs. This one is very light and the suction is tremendous. However, our bedroom carpet is deep and plush. The self adjusting feature doesn't adjust enough for this type carpet. The machine is very hard to push on the carpet, and the brush and wheels leave deep tracks. We have to rake the carpet after vacuuming. I recommend the vacuum if your carpet is not the deep and plush variety.
I like the buttons that light up and they are just at your finger-tips. The Vacuum is lightweight to move around and the power is great too. The vacuum is so lightweight and powerful that it almost wants to propel itself across the carpet. I also like that there is a collection of the platinum Vacuum products which I have 4.
Haven't gotten a chance to use. Hope to use this weekend.
I have two Siberian Huskies so I needed a vacuum capable of picking up a ton of dog hair. So far this vacuum has exceeded my expectations. It has a tremendous amount of power and is very light and easy to use. Works great on wood, tile, and carpet. The only downside is the lack of attachments to the vacuum. It comes with a smaller separate vacuum pack but it is a pain to have to switch them out just to get under the furniture.
I have been using this vacumm for 2 months. so far, I am very happy with this product. It is lighth in weight compare to other similar style vacuums. it cleans very well for wall to wall carpets. thanks to the other reviews, I am careful in using the handle since some people .complained that the handle breaks easily. I am giving 4 stars only because I have use this product for 2 months.the small vacuum is helpful for small spaces and corners. it is true that the tube is kind of short.
imho, this vac would be great for all carpet floors only. our floors are all hardwood with area rugs. we had to return and exchanged for the hoover wind tunnel self propel. very happy now with our new wind tunnel.
The upright is lightweight and powerful; works just as well on bare floor as it does on carpet and that is what I was looking for. The canister's suction power is not as strong as the upright but the convenience of it is wonderful.
Great vacuum! An excellent purchase as the second vacuum in my home. It is good for all types of floor surfaces. I really like the small handheld vacuum that is included that I can use in my car or on the stairs. I do not have any animals so I cannot speak about pet hair. I do have children who are asthmatics so having a HEPA filter was important to me. It's also good for bedbugs since you must have a disposable bag. It's not quite as good as my Dyson, but for the price it's an excellent vacuum, thus the four stars.
Awesome suction power that completely captured all the dirt that was circulating in my home's carpets for years. Filled up one bag to dispose of. On the downside, the motor failed after 1.5 years of owning it. Its a good thing Hoover backs the product with a 6 year warranty. The authorized service dealer said Hoover will often times just send a new one instead of repairing the motor which takes more time. I hope this will be the case.
This upright vaccum does all it claims to do. The only downfall to the upright is it does not have an ajustable leveler for shag then floor. I love the light on when bag is full. However, the canister vaccum does not have this feature. However, it does pick up well on my hard surfaces.
lve this item , very light weight , easy to use , dust free , cleans very well ..just one problem bags are very hard too find .
My housekeeper is very happy with both units. I'm not so happy using it on my VERY high cut pile 8 x 12 area rug. I have a difficult time moving the vac and find that I have to drag it rather than moving it backwards and forwards. On the lower setting it handles smaller area rugs very well. The cannister unit works well on all my wooden shutters, wood walls, popcorn ceilings, and fan blades. Not so good on the upholstery. Short of using duct tape, the wand and accessories don't stay together well. I have been unable to find filters in any retail store however, just found them on this site. They are fairly pricey however, I have no resident family and my dog doesn't shed so they have lasted quite a long time. If I had it to do over, I'd have kept my old upright that self propelled!
I actually just bought this product a few hours ago and was excited to try it out. I have never spent this much money before on a vaccum. I can't help but be concerned about this vaccum lasting. I vaccumed my daughters room and was impressed and then I used the canister for the stairs and was really smiling from ear to ear. But I still am leary about this vaccum. Because of it's high tech technology. I did notice that when I was vaccuming my daughters room it shut off and I had to unplug it to turn it back on. So I am not so sure yet!
I have been very pleased with my past windtunnel vaccuums, I figured I couldn't go wrong, but I would never have bought it if I had known how hard it would be to find replacement bags for it. The suction is very good and it's so light and the head is very compact, making it really easy to use on stairs except that it has no hoses to clean the very back of the step. I have to get out 2 vaccuums to get the job done.
I wanted a simple upright that wouldn't clog easily. Also prefer the bags to bagless to reduce dust. The canister was a special bonus and both are so lightweight and easy to put together and use. Very satisfied.
The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner. I used to have a Dyson Animal, and while not needing bags was nice, it was all but impossible to not get a cloud of dust when emptying it. Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson.
Have had Hoovers for the past 20 years. Went looking for a new vacuum and came upon the Platinum. It's wonderful but I would like to be able to unwind the cord easier, the hook where you wind the cord should rotate making the cord slid off, I had that feature on my old Hoover. other wise so far its been great.
I purchased this product based on two things. I wanted to get away from bagless and I wanted to buy a quality vac. I was so tired of vaccuming up a huge pile of junk and then having to empty it out and then clean out the filter.

The Hoover did cost more than I had planned to spend but, I got the quality I hoped for. My carpets looked fantastic after just one cleaning! The sleek old-school style and windtunnel purring of the motor was another plus. You get what you pay for, right.
Works great, technologically friendly, stylish, lightweight, easy to store, great purchase even though expensive. The canister is excellent too but noisy as heck - you need earplugs ! but it works well too, although the main attachment head kept falling off.
I bought this vacuum because it is lightweight and bagged. I love it. Totally. But the included cannister has serious issues: the floor brush won't stay on the wand without duct tape(!) the upholstry brush is useless--very small and the dusting brush is non-existent (some strange thing you fit onto the upholstry brush). What was Hoover thinking I still have to use my old cannister vacuum to handle upholstry, stairs and furniture dusting. What a disappointment.
I use on my carpets, stairs and furniture. I like that it is light weight but I realy miss the retractable power cord. The part of vacuuming I dislike the most is winding up the power cord.
Very good vacuum. After going through 1 vacuum every 18 mos, we decided to go to a simple design (less to break). The gimmicke vacuums seem to be cheaply made, and lose suction after 6 mos or so.
Very light weight.Works better than any bagless vacuum
I like the installation, it did seem to be very secure. It does offer a good handle for help getting in and out of bed and a help for them to reach and rollover.
IT is very helpfull getting out OF bed.

great prices and fast shipping
I was glad to see this box set that included all 6 Resident Evil movies. Been wanting all of them for some time but didn't want to pay for them separately
Nice box set of all 5 of the resident evil movies. Gave them as a gift and they loved them all.
Honestly, no one watches a movie like this because it has the greatest plot; they watch it for the action. The acting talent was great, the action sequences were good and the plot was descent, even with the plot holes. Overall, these were highly entertaining films, though some were better than others.As for the discs, it irritated me that they are set up so if the movie is stopped before it is finished you have to go thorough all of the FBI warnings and then search the movie to find your spot unless you set a bookmark from the menu before the disc is stopped.
Someone stole my DVDs so I was so happy that best buy had all 5 in one :)
Absolutely love these movies (more so than the games) and this box set is the perfect way to add them all to your library
If a fan of RE than this is for you. All five in Blu-Ray together at great price.
This is a great boxed set for a great price, thanks! :-)
These movies are very loosely based on the Resident Evil video game series, but they're still fun action-filled movies with great stunts and cool visuals!
This set provides a great collection of all of the Resident Evil movies so far. The Picture quality is great!
Purchased the movie to round out my collection of the franchise. It did not disappoint.
I was very pleased to be able to pickup the Resident Evil collection at the price it was on sale for!!!!
This is a great purchase for any resident evil fan. To get all of the movies at the bargain price that I did is simply a steal!
Good movies, great for resident evil fans, good special features
I'm a big movie collector and this set was a great add to my collection. I have always enjoyed The Resident Evil franchise and games. I would definitely recommend this series to a friend.
Classic collection of horror movie she is good in all 5
The Resident Evil series doesn't require deep thought or reflection, but on balance it is better than it has a right to be, although the fifth installment was a bit too much like a videogame (I know the movies are based on a video game, but the last installment had a little too much of that feel to me). It's a great series of movies for exercise on a treadmill or spinner bike.
Over a good series in my opinion, best way to have the series all in one place.
Doesn't necessarily follow the same story as the video games. But it's decent for the fans. Plus the price isn't bad.
Couldn't pass this deal up and I completed the whole collection in one set. Love it!!
Convenient package of all the movies if you didn't get them as they came out
After the second one, I really couldn't stand the movies, but my wife loves them. Even with that, it's a great set, and a good price. Includes:Resident Evil - A guilty pleasure that mixes a few points from the video game with an overall good zombie flick.Resident Evil: Apocalypse - A definite attempt to merge the first movie with more elements from the game.Resident Evil: Extinction - Um... who put zombies in Mad Max?Resident Evil: Afterlife - This movie was primarily made to undo the third one and overuse every 3D gag in existence.Resident Evil: Retribution - Like the fourth one, but want more... everything? Then this movie is for you.
Has a great story line and kickass star. Good quality discs
Great series, Milla pulls off this character in all the movies. Some of it is a little out there but building a 5 movie "quintology"? based off a video game is quite impressive
great price for the blue ray collection good quality
Though the series has declined some as time has gone on, it is still an enjoyable one to watch from beginning to end. Can't wait for the last film next year.
All the action on all 5 films in one blu-ray box set sold!
A box set only including the individual discs that you could purchase separately in a nice slipcase. Nothing too special.These films aren't great, but if you love the games and you've seen these before you'll love it!
I like the complete series in one nice packaging plus the digital copies for all the movies. All for a very good price.
these movies are great for fans of the games and non fans alike...The films got better and better and better. 2 things missing: in-depth features helping those not familiar with the games see how they are all related; and the inclusion of the CG animated films in the series would have been nice.
Good to get the entire "resident" collection for a better than decent price. Thumbs up to Best Buy for the fast shipping!
Thank you, I wish to see them again. M.J. sequels get better.
Very cool storyline. Some of the movies are better than others in the series but, good overall.
Purchased as a gift for a teenager. The girls all watched the movie the very same day and they enjoyed it.
Milla Jovovich is The Perfect "Kick Butt" hero. She plays her role well and manages to look great doing it.
It's nice to have all of these on blu ray and it didn't cost much
I love zombies. I love these movies. Watch them. Now
I wasn't into these movies when they came out, but glad I bought the box set. Just another good purchase to add to my growing collection.
It was a good collection. It started off kind of slow but it really got going.
It's looks amazing with the blue ray and amazing zombie action
Convenient packaging for a great series. Each film is faced with new challenges.
These films just keep getting better. Non-stop action and gore. They're even making a sixth film.
It was nice to find as a set. I had an issue redeeming digital copy however Sony pictures customer support was quick to fix it.
I love Alice and her quest to bring down the Umbrella Corporation. I finally have all of the movies in one set. I watch these every chance I can. Looking forward to the last installment.
Very impressed with this box set, always been a big fan of them!
Overall a very good box set. Resident Evil movies have non-stop action and great CGI. Milla is the perfect actress to play the lead role. Looking forward to seeing the last movie for this collection coming out in 2017.
Great set of movies that take the source story from the games and makes it their own.
Great way to catch up on the movies. Purchased while it was on sale for $14 so couldn't complain considering it was Blu-ray quality.
This was an opportunity to upgrade some of my favorite movies without having to buy them individually. I usually wait for the bundled series to go on sale like this set was.
The collection itself is great (got it on sale for 29.99 and had a gift card), however it states that you get a digital HD version, which would lead one to assume it is a digital HD version of the entire collection.THIS IS NOT THE CASEYou only get the digital copy of retribution. I spoke with multiple reps at best buy and all of them stated that it should come with the entire collection.The price was great, it's a great set of movies but the advertisement for digital HD is incorrect and not what I was looking for. Make sure you realize you are only getting ONE movie in digital HD
Great movies all in one set. Great price. Action and color vibrany
These movies are always ones that I am willing to watch from the past
Some better than others and none as good as the game but still like it.
Get the best of the resident evil movies in one set
Even though they don't really follow the lore laid out in the games, they are still good action movies! They are a good homage to the games and the Resident Evil universe in general, well worth watching.
A good set of blu ray films at a great price as well
Was a really good set of movies. Had the blu Ray version and digital copies
Great movie collection. If you like zombie movies!
I like most of this series. A couple of the movies are a bit cheesy but still like the action.
if your looking to just buy all the movies at once then this is for you
Usually these boxed sets are great because they come in a slimmer package and you can save some shelf space. But if anything this actually takes up MORE space because the box casing just holds the five normal blu-rays. So I docked it a point for that, but it's otherwise great if you're a fan of the films, and you really can't go wrong at 14.99 (even if you already had one or two of them it's a great deal).
