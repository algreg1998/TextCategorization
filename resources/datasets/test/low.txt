Me and my husband used the shea butter version for years and loved it. Our hands were moisturized and eczema free. Not so with the new version. Neither one of us can use this.
This used to be the moisturizing cream with shea butter which was superb. Now the shea butter has been replaced with meadowfoam oil and it is absolutely horrible. Why do I need meadowfoam oil on my skin Does that even work These days they are just putting any kind of oil in any cream to cut corners and save money. But nothing moisturizes as good as Shea Butter :(
The original product was amazing, this new one is not even comparable! I've searched high and low and have ordered what shows a BLUE cap and SHEA BUTTER, only to get this new Meadowfoam Oil version. Such a waste of money, shipping and time. Whay change a great product
I bought the new meadowfoam oil moisturizer and it is thin and extremely greasy. Not a fan. Why would they get rid of the moisturizer with Shea butter On the hunt for the old kind...
I do not like the new version. It is too greasy and oily. Bring back the old version!!
Very disappointed with reformulation of product. Shea butter version outstanding. Meadowfoam oil version is greasy. Too bad, finding another product

I gave it a five star on Taste because it is a good Flavor had the coffee creamers before. Found on Walmart individual creamers and ordered for home delivery. Individual box damaged creamer box wet from the liquid creamers. Someone had packed in one shipping parcel.... 25 lb. Litter and added fragile grocery items. The Coffee creamers were damaged.
I work outside a lot, use sun screen daily, and with living in Southern CA, I am always on the lookout for sunscreen that is more natural instead of chemicals. I like the zinc sunscreens, but I do not like how they make your skin look chalky and are hard to wash off. Especially for day to day use, going to meetings with a chalky face, is not the professional look I am going for. This sunscreen is great because it has zinc, but it also has oils that helps it spreads smoothly, so you do not get that chalky buildup.So why the one star Well, I am not sure that everyone else got the same sun screen that I did.... it smells awful! It smells like if you ripped open a smelly leaf, rubbed it in kerosene, then added some lemon zest. It gave me a headache after 2 mins, made my sister sneeze uncontrollably after one sniff, and I could not get any of my co-workers to try it after one whiff. The only good part, is that it washed off easily, no residue, no smell. Makes me wonder about it's waterproof ability -- the other sunscreen I use is the scentless Blue Lizard which is great for swimming -- it's so waterproof that you can see the water bead up off your skin once you apply it. Which also makes it impossible to scrub off. Alas, you can't have it all!!
I bought this last week to use on my infant son and have to return it due to the very heavy fragrance - a major irritant for sensitive skin/eczema. I am disappointed as the other ingredients sounded promising, but nothing that is marketed for use for babies or eczema should be so scented. I dabbed just a bit on my own hands (where I have eczema breakouts) and it stung, was very greasy, and the smell clung for hours afterwards even after washing/wiping off. Would not recommend. I cannot comment on the quality or effectiveness as we will not be using it.
Is this product suppose to have a grainy texture It takes forever to rub in. Other shea products are not this way. Is this normal I would have inquired through email rather than a review, but there is not Contact Us on the site.
I hate this lotion! I guess I should have smelled it before I purchased it. The smell is overpowering and nauseating. I put it on the first time and washed it off immediately. I keep trying to adjust to the smell, but it's just too much. I will be throwing the rest of the bottle away. You've been warned - the smell is obnoxious.
After a few minutes, this lotion forms a coating on the skin which starts rubbing, or peeling off in flakes when touched. Even gets onto clothing. First time I ever felt the need to wash off lotion from my skin with soap and water!
First of all i love this coffee and target is one of my favorite stores. But his last order, i ordered 9 bags of this coffee and EVERY one of them was expired (4 months ago). I mean, i really didnt expect this from Target.
I'm bewildered by the good reviews this stuff gets. In my opinion, it's pretty much useless-- like spraying plain water on stains. I've tried it on both fresh breastmilk and spitup stains and diaper stains on baby clothing from blowout overflow and it does absolutely NOTHING on either of them. We've been much more successful just using a teaspoon of straight baby laundry detergent on the stains. I tried soaking my baby's stained clothes in cold water so that the stains wouldn't dry until I could get the items in the wash, then treated them with this spray and let them sit for 15 mins before starting the machine. The clothes came out of the wash looking exactly like they went in.
Color description and pictured were black, grey, beige. There was actually blue in the lamp shade. Had to return as it did not match the room.
This is NOT POWDER! It is mineral makeup and goes on thick and cake-y. The description here on WalMart's web site is misleading and incorrect. I bought it in Buff Beige, which usually matches for me, but this stuff looked orange. THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY SINCE I CANNOT RETURN IT.
Didn't like this product
Used this hairspray religiously - bought a fresh can one day, noticed a different scent. Used it, noticed that it wasn't holding nearly as well. Though it was a fluke, bought another can. Same thing - new scent, not working. Compared ingredients with old can, and behold (get it HOLD Or not, as the case may be) listed first with the ingredients on old (working) can: 1157620 A....compared with first listing on new can: 1157620 B. So we have can A (works) and can B (smells different, doesn't hold half as well). I've since gone to many stores trying to find left over can A's and I got a pretty decent supply for a while, but now all stores only carry can B (non-working, but better smelling). And I found other reviews online with the same drawn conclusion, so I know I'm not crazy. Anyway, unless I can find a way to get another stash of can A, I'm going to have to find another brand that holds. Suggestions welcome! :)
bought this as a replacement for another discontinued L'Oreal product. Left my hair looking dull and feeling strawlike. I try not to wash my hair every day, but had to with this now because it just left it looking awful. Don't buy.
I brought this product and use it for the first time. It did not hold my hair after I sprayed it. I re-fixed my hair and sprayed it again, it fell down in less than a hour after I resprayed it, water would have worked better than this. I do not recommend this product.
Extremely flaky! Do not recommend. I was hopeful as I'm happy with Loreal products. This is awful.
These cookies used to be pretty good. They were soft and chewy and had a somewhat homemade baked feel to them.Keebler changed the recipe though. The packaging now states, New Look! Same Great TasteSorry Keebler, but they do not have the same great taste. They don't even have a good taste. In fact, these new cookies are downright terrible. There are barely any chocolate chips in each cookie and they now taste like stale cookies that have been sitting around for a week.Keebler clearly cut some costs on this new recipe and it shows. The quality is extremely poor.If you want some delicious, soft cookies that taste like they are homemade and are reasonably priced, try Matt's Chocolate Chip Cookies. They are by far the best packaged chocolate chip cookies I have ever had....
We subscribed and saved to these and go 5 boxes of dry, crumbly, stale, old cookies that are barely edible. Extremely disappointing and all five boxes were the same way.
THE COOKIES TASTE STEAL AND ARE ALL BROKEN UP DONT WAIST TIME GO TO SUPERMARKET SAVE YOUR MONEY TERRIBLE TERRIBLE
I sent this as a gift to a college student. Delicious, he said, and a good value I said! Easy to order and ship. I can't eat them, but in sure do like to send them to people who can.
These must have been old. They taste stale. So sad as there are a lot in the package. Would not buy through here again
I brought this last night and it didnt help at all... Maybe only for a min and the pain comes back. I use to love oral gel. The old formula was very good.
That cream is supposedc to relieve your pain but I guess it is for something else because it sure did not make the pain go away. Even after several applications, the pain was still here and i could not sleep. It said pm but nothing. the generic brand worked better. I would not recommend.
Pick this up to get me thru a couple nights till my dentist appt. worked for about 5 minites then pain was right back. Not worth the time to walk thru the store to buy it
As of lately you guys have decided to switch to a new kind of formula for your gel. well let me just tell you it is absolutely horrible! it gives very little too absolutely no relief and the few and I mean very few times it does the relief only lasts and meer minute or two. I would advise you switch back to the old formula because that actually did some good. In fact I really wish I had some here now. This after being a long time user of your product has now made me highly suspect of any other Orajel products.
I just opened a new tube of biotene oral balance gel, put some in my mouth and then had to go out in the kitchen and spit it out in a paper towel. It wasn't the same consistency as previous tubes. It was runny and tasted different. I figured it was a bad batch. Now I see they've changed the formula. I don't know if I can keep using it.
The new and improved pH balance oral gel is not as effective as the older biotene oral gel. In the past, the oral gel would moisture my mouth all night.The new formula is liquidy, not a gel, and not at all effective. I will have to search for a new oral moisturizer. Very disappointing!
I've been using your mouth gel for 5 years but the new formula for mouth gel is no where near as good. It is too thin and runny and doesn't last more than an hour or two. With the old formula I used to get 4 hours sleep at a time. So I have increased cost for an inferior product.
The old formula of the gel prevented my severe dry mouth symptoms and allowed me 4 hours sleep between applications. The new stuff immediately pools in my mouth and I am forced to spit it out. It's practically useless. Please return to the old formula. It was such a great product.
You used to have a great product. By now you must notice that the new formula is NOT improved. Don't know how long you think sales will continue what with the comments you are getting. I don't like the idea of parabens in the new formula. Can't you please resume the old formula
User for years. The new formula simply does not work at night. It is too thin, so disappears down my throat despite my efforts not to swallow it. Also sweet and burns, as other reviewers have noted. From excellent product to worthless. Any way to get back to old formula
The new formulation doesn't work as well as the old. It's thin and doesn't last very long at all. Bring back the old ingredients that work!!!
Horribly disappointed in the new product. The taste is overwhelming and not suitable for anyone with sensitivity of taste or sensation......
I have had no long-lasting relief from either the gel or the spray, seems to last maybe 3-5 minutes maximum 10 min
yuk!!!!!horrible taste like vomit disgusting you people should keep to original flavour what a let down yuk
The viscosity of Biotene Gel has been changed and it is nearly runny as water. This stuff worked all night long for me for many years, but the new formula only helps for a few minutes. It doesn't even get one star from me. I will not buy it again.
Used since 1996 after radiation eliminated my saliva. The new product does not last long after application due in part to its watery nature...Please, please bring the old formulation back. or where can I obtain same!!! In short I need help.
I used your old formulation for years at night and it worked very well for me. It lasted for hours and kept my mouth moist. The new product is much thinner than the old and dissipates within minutes. Please bring back the old formulation.
I have been using biotene gel toothpaste for years for dry mouth due to medications. I have tried both the Fluoride Fresh Mint Original as well as the Oral Balance Gel they both burn my mouth, Please bring back the old original Gel.
I have bought Biotene gel for my mother for years. As so many others have asked - why the reformulation I'm willing to pay for a product that works, not this one. Have you noticed the of unhappy reviews This is a fail...
The new formula does not work like the old formula did. It liquefies too easily and therefore doesn't coat as well. The taste is not as pleasant and in general the product is less effective. Please bring back the old formula!
I was excited to finally try biotene. Unfortunately, I'm unable to evaluate its effectiveness since the shockingly-sweet taste has prevented me from using the tube more than a handful of times in the several months since I purchased it. I frequently see it in the drawer in which I keep my dental products and consider using it, but the anticipation of its taste stops me cold. I'd love to try a neutral or non-sweetened formula in the future.
I have been using Oral Balance every night for over 8 years. It has made a huge difference for me and I have told many people about its benefits. Unfortunately, the formula has recently changed and I find it very unsatisfactory. The new formula is thinner, dissolves too quickly and does not last the night. I'm very disappointed and hope you will bring back the old formula.
The change you have made in the formula of the Biotene gel has definitely made it ineffective. I along with numerous other people raved about how well the gel worked. No more. I discussed this with my dentist and he too has had many complaints from patients that the new formula gel no longer works. Disappointed that you changed a wonderful product into a bad one.
I am a CPAP user and the old formula worked very well. The new one does not help much. Please bring back the old formula!!!
Have used Biotene Gel for a couple of years and it WAS terrific. The formula has recently changed and it no longer works... the gel is thinner and doesn't last. I no longer receive any relief from this product. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!
It doesn't last 5 minutes and the spray was better than the gel.
I have used Biotene products for years for dry mouth. I do not want xylitol, I do want aloe vera. I'll not be purchasing your products again until the old formula returns.
I have used Oral Balance, Biotene Toothpase, and Mouthwash for 16+ years since Dry Mouth diagnoses. These products were a godsend! Now the formula has changed and I am at a loss as to what to do. They took out the enzyme system, aloe vera. The gel is basically 4 ingredients now. Very thin and the sugar alcohols give me cramping and diarrhea. The green label mouthwash is still good. They also removed the enzyme formula from the blue label mouthwash and the toothpaste. The taste of the toothpaste is toooooo strong now and burns my mouth and tonque. The gel is sickeningly sweet. Biotene, please fix your products. Seems to me like they decided to go the least expensive route for them. I am so discouraged.
I have used this product and for me it didn't work. I didn't like having to brush your tongue, I prefer a rinse or toothpaste. I gagged every time I used the product. I did not notice any less dryness of my mouth. Maybe a different form of the product would have been better for me.
I can't say that I really see the benefit in using this product. I decided to use Biotene Oral Balance Gel before bed one night since I tend to wake up with a dry mouth from time to time. The gel was much different than what I had imagined it would be. It was a little more liquid-y. I applied some to my mouth and I noticed that the box stated that it should last for about 4 hours. 4 hours is a good amount of time to last if you don't wake up in the middle of the night. Needless to say, I tend to wake up from time to time throughout the night. I woke up that night and not only was my mouth dry again, but also had a funky taste from the gel. The good part is that falling asleep was easier for me. My mouth tends to dry out soon after I go to bed, but I didn't feel like I needed to get water before falling asleep this time!
I wanted it to work for me, but it gave me headaches. The headaches went away after I stopped using it, but i guess its just my body chemistry. Maybe others would have better luck. I did try multiple times over two weeks and this was the only change in my day to day, so it had to be this product that didn't agree with me. Too bad.
Biotene Toothpaste is no longer recommended by me. I can't even use it anymore because they changed the taste. The mint flavor now is overpowering. I have bought Biotene for years because every other brand was offensively strong in mint, and Biotene was mild. I do not have dry mouth. But now, the box says NEW Improved pH Balance, the cute flip-up cap is gone, and the taste is unbearable. Either I got a bad batch, or some new executive has screwed up what used to be a very good product.
I wanted to try this because my mouth is always very dry. I'm constantly holding a glass of water and refill it (22 oz) 4-5 times a day, just to keep my mouth comfortable. I read the directions, put (approximately, I didn't actually measure my finger tip) a half inch line on my finger and put it on my tongue, spread it around as the directions stated. It took about 5 minutes, then the burning started. My mouth, everywhere it touched is on fire! I don't know who at the company thought this was a good idea, but it's awful. It's been an hour and I'm still burning despite rinsing well several times. My tongue and the inside of my cheeks are too raw feeling to use a toothbrush to clean them. This is a terrible product, it's in the trash now.
Beware - the formula for my beloved Oral Balance has been radically changed, and for the worse. Those good for your mouth enzymes are gone, and it now contains sodium hydroxide which burns my mouth, tongue and throat! What a loss. A great product for dry mouth sufferers is gone. The new one is more than useless for people with dry mouth. I used this product multiple times a day and now I'm looking for a replacement product and haven't been able to find anything.
Some time ago, perhaps the beginning of 2014 or thereabouts, Biotene changed the formula of this product. I used to swear by it for solving dry mouth problems overnight where long-term efficacy was required. However, the NEW! PH-balanced formula has been watered down so that its effectiveness longevity has been severely compromised. In addition, the new formula has a very caustic or acidic edge inevitably one is going to have to swallow some of this goo during use, and in my case (and many others -- read the reviews on Amazon and on Biotene's web site) the formulation provides a very unpleasant throat-burning experience for a good 20-minutes after it is applied, which certainly doesn't help one get to sleep! This new product seems about as far from pH-balanced as you can get. The only reason I buy this product anymore is because it's the only real player in the game for relief that lasts longer than a couple of hours, and because I can still blend it with the contents of some travel packs of the old gel that I still have and have found more of online. After that stash runs out, I don't know what I will do. I guess I'm hoping Biotene realizes they made a huge Coca-Cola reformulation error and restores the old formula -- or at least remedies the horrible caustic edge this formulation suffers from. Wal-Mart does have the best pricing I have been able to find to date (another problem with this product -- it's ridiculously expensive -- prior to the reformulation you could buy it for 3.99 / tube).
Web site is very confusing. I believed I was ordering 6 bottles at 4.35 eash insteas I recieved 3 bottles for 23.39.I ended up paying 7.50 a bottle. Not such a good deal
Sooo drying and won't go on lips if I put on lip balm beforehand, and they're not even very pigmented. Makes your lipstick look even more feathered and uneven than when applied alone.
I like to add black rice to soup this is the first to turn my soup black should state on directions to precook and rinse.
I can not recommend this lotion, it doesn't relieve the itch. It isn't absorbed by the skin so it feels sticky and tacky, very uncomfortable under clothing. This friction keeps the itchy spot feeling itchy. Also, you smell medicated all day.
I have been a regular user of the regular Just for men hair color and have been satisfied with the results. But there has been a time or two when I have not been watching the time close enough and the color had gotten too dark, and looked phoney. So i was very interested to try this product . I was very careful to follow the instructions as I wanted to be sure of the result in comparison the the regular product. I did become concerned too when the coloring began to appear very black but the instructions did warn about this and so I continued to 10 minutes. When I did rinse out the autostop I found in fact I had very little to none in coverage of the grey. I had to redo it with the regular Just for Men hair color product.
I have been a long time user of just for men. I've had good results with the traditional product but thought the new product would be simpler. It wasn't. What I found was a lack of control in using the product. The original formula is more like a fluid which you can nicely control to target gray roots and edges. This product is waxy and feels like a stiff helmet like coating. The edges were broader and skin stained darker. Also the previously colored ends looked really dark. I had to use a color remover to get ends to lighten. I will go back to original or try another brand. Since I've had this experience I've read multiple product reviews and have an alternate I will try.
I'VE BEEN A CLIENT OF JUST FOR MEN SINCE ABOUT 3 YEARS AND I LIKE YOUR PRODUCT. I TRIED LAST TIME THIS NEW ONE WITH THE COMB. I WAS HAPPY AT THE BEGINNING SINCE AS YOU PROMOTE IT, THIS IS VERY EASY TO USE AND WITH NO MESS, BUT NO RESULTS AT ALL. I FOLLOWED ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE RESULTS THAT ME AND RELATIVES FOUND OUT IS THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD RESULTS AT ALL, THE GREAY HAIR REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME BY ABOUT 85.
I tried the new AutoStop product recently and was highly disappointed. I have been a Touch of Grey user for a few years and find it to be a much superior product. The AutoStop product turned my hair darker than it should have been, to the point of embarrassing because it was easy to tell that I had dyed my hair. I would not recommend this product at all. Can I get a refund
I did it 3 times, 5 minutes first two times, third time waited 15 minutes, then shower, and after .....voila, same as before i started I tried to upload 3 pics, all 3 pics were as per you to big, actual size of pic, one inch square, give me a regular email address, and i send you before , during and after process pics
These are the worst Samsung product ever to make it to market. They do a mediocre job of playing music but are not anywhere near usable for talking. Most of my phone calls I end up turning the headset off and talking on my phone instead. There needs to be a firmware update or recal for the poor quality that bear the Samsung name.
When using the headset for my iPhone, the other person can hear me. Sounds like I'm muffled
People are telling me they can't hear me hardly. Not enough talk time and slides off neck if not careful
Very poor sound quality. Volume low. We have less expensive headsets with better sound.
Hard to pair with other devices, disconnect frequently, poor sound, lots of back ground noise. Battery life is poor around 6 hours or less, does not tell you if battery is low to recharge it just turns off. Worst way to spend your money, and it is very pricy for the money
Three issues. 1- ear buds don't stay in my ear. Any movement and they fall out. 2- battery wouldn't hardly last 4hrs before the unit died. 3- I owned this product for about 2 months before they just broke And won't turn on.
So I returned mine to the store. Everyone said I sounded far away and it had no way to control incoming calls. Not what I expected at all!
Cannot synch with many phones. Circle is much better. Charge will last less than a day.
Everyone I talk to can not hear me on this Bluetooth
Not satisfied at all everyone I talk to say they can't hear me and I go back to holding my phone
I purchased this as a replacement for my LG head phones that were damaged. Issues with the loose ear buds tangling and after peering with my Samsung galaxy note 4 it went down hill in fast forward motion, person I called or whoever called me couldn't hear me... HORRIBLE....
I bought two of these. Took the first one back because I thought it was defective, it wasn't. Noise cancelling does nothing. Returned the second pair and purchased the Bose.
These wireless noise canceling headphones sounded horrible. The voice sounded horrible according to the people I called.
Unless your not planning Onusing The Phone function on these headphones don't waste your money although the sound on music is not bad. Phone function sucks the person on the other line can never hear you no matter if you press the button that supposed to help with that. Only way these are worth anything is if you get them for under $50 because you can get better headphones for $60 that sounds way better than this I would not recommend these. Ever !
I purchased this item on 3/09 and the head set just stop working on 3/17. Before it went out when I made or received calls they would tell me I sound muffled. I would not purchase again.
These are not for a truck driver or some who does a lot of driving
Got these to replace the samsung active which broke and had these a week and took them back cause no one could hear me talk on these. I could yell and they still could not hear me. So I took these back and LG tone pro.
I've own 3 LG headsets and this one has had the best call quality with respect to ambient noise etc. The problem is that the with the LG headsets the earpieces are magnetic and therefore there is no strain put on the wires. The Samsung design leaves the wires to handle all the stress of the dangling earpieces. It's only a matter of time (in my case 2 months after the warranty ran out) before the wire insulation separates from the earpiece and only a bit longer I'm sure before the wire contacts fail.
The headset did not perform well at all. When listening to music the sound would constantly cut out for around 1second intervals and almost every time I made a phone call I would have to turn them off and just use the phone due to no one being able to hear me.
Very uncomfortable inside the ear; claims to have noise cancellation which is practically non-existent; earbud tips are a huge PITA to switch out & do almost nothing to improve fit or comfort. The only positive is that, unlike the LG Tone earbuds, no special software (Tone & Talk) has to be downloaded to get them to work. Returning tomorrow.
I bought these earphones being a big Samsung customer and fan. I have no idea how they sound because they would not stay in my ear long enough for me to even turn them on. I tried every size plug, but because of they way they're constructed the hard plastic "stem" made them pop out of my ears. I can't believe the poor ergonomics of these beautiful looking earbuds.Never had this problem with other brands.I ended up buying the best model of the competitor's and originator of the design and they're great.
The reception on this item is horrible. Individuals on the other end of the call cannot hear anything you are saying. I had to return this item and received a full refund.
I had high hopes for this headset however it failed the comfortably of the headsets is amazing. However call quality is horrible. Everyone said they can barely hear me while talking. For pure working out and listening to music but daily use with phone calls it a flop.
I bought these thinking they would be good for mowing the yard and listening to music and maybe answer the phone if it rings. NOT SO! the sound quality was easily beaten by my ear buds that came with my phone. the mic sounds as though it is in the bottom of my pocket, very soft quiet sound and all the audio sounds like mumbling. also they have a gig delay to and from the phone. I called and talked to my wife sitting next to me and I could here a 1-2 second delay coming from the phone to the headset and she said there was about the same delay from the headset to the phone. I will be taking these back tomorrow.
People said it sounded like I was talking under water. I immediately returned it to Best Buy.
No one could hear me when trying to speak through these headphones. They was ok to listen to music. They could be a little louder.
So inconvenient and unattractive how the buds just hang. Not sure friendly.
The sound is beautiful but the microphone does not work returns the product two times
Sound is very low and headset is heavy and not comfortable when on neck
when making phone calls receiver can barely hear me not very comfortable in ear
Took back because they did not work well. Caller was not able to hear my voice very well.
Tried 2 headsets and both had horrible connection. People could not understand me. I had to go back to the Level U Pro (without noise cancellation)
Received today. The plastic part of the lid came broken, the blush wasn't evenly distributed, so it left a little hill in the middle causing the plastic part to pop up. The color is lighter then pictured. I will be returning due to it not being able to close right. Can not comment on application.
Loved the color in the pan, and blush itself is a very pretty color when applied, but there is so much glitter you look like you put craft glitter on your face :( if the glitter wasnt so overdone, it would be nice. this could be a good party night blush, but not a day blush for work/school.
This goes on so beautiful at first. Then 5 minutes later the color is gone! I have to keep reapplying.
Sparkly mess isn't worth the hassle.
This scent is truly AWFUL. I wanted to like it. I really did. However, I was very disappointed.
This looked so nice, but unfortunately arrived broken at the top opening of the dispenser. (thin styrofoam inside that separates the lid from dispenser base, and only 1 layer of bubble wrap around the box) Reordering in hopes of it arriving in tact next time.
It was broken
I purchased these for my son's birthday party. Filled them with lemonade and water. The drink dispenser with lemonade was almost empty. I picked up the container, and the entire thing broke in my hands. The bottom broke completely off, spilling the rest of the liquid. Hopefully no one was injured. I threw the second one away because I didn't want the same thing to happen. Especially at a kids birthday party.
Did not like either the cookie component or the peanut butter.
received in 3/10/16, box had expiration date of 4/12/16
I wanted the peanut butter sandwiches that come 1 to a pack and are a healthy option. these are nothing more than cookies
I bought this pan to make a pumpkin birthday cake for my daughter and it did not turn out the way you would think. The leaves and stem on it barely show up and you CAN NOT frost it unless you want it to end up looking like a big ball of frosting. It was an expensive misunderstanding. I guess thats what you would call it.
I have occasional breakouts. I bought it to keep my pores clean. My skin is combination/oily. It is true that the product creates a cooling sensation but that is only during the washing process. About 10 minutes after I used the product my face felt like it was on fire. I figured it was the acne medicine in the product that was working. I continued to use the product for 3 more days. My face dried out, itched, and my skin hurt to touch it, and that was with using moisturizer after washing my face. Each day got progressively worse and then I started to have worse acne breakouts that were under the skin and very painful. I haven't had breakouts like that in years. Then I started noticing brown spots appear on the surface of my skin like my skin had been burned! I stopped using the product right away and switched to tea tree oil. My face stopped itching immediately and the redness went away. I was very disappointed and will NEVER use this product again.
It works like a charm to keep acne under control, and it feels so cool and refreshing on the skin! There's nothing else like it!
this product claims to help get your glasses sparkling clean... when I used it they come out of the dishwasher with a milky like film on them. I only use it to clean out the dishwasher. I run the dishwasher empty with the soap compartment full of the booster... it does help clean it out but that is about all it does.
After several uses this product took the finish off my everyday dishes ... I used the product as directed. I had to replace all my dishes. this works on glassware but definitely not on Mikasa stoneware. My entire set of dishes were ruined by this product!
I had high hopes for this product given all of the rave reviews. I noticed absolutely NO difference in my glassware or stainless after using this product.
This product will NOT remove film from clear glass ware. So far, I have not found ANY product that will. I am still looking.
I bought this and used it in my dishwasher, but should have thoroughly checked it out. My rustic enamelware (CAMPING GEAR) was ruined by the acidity of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product took off a design on a cup. I have used other products multiple times and this never happened. Only when I used this product did the design complete come off. Was really disappointed because I was looking forward to trying this out. Would not recommend and will not be purchasing.
I got to try this as a free sample, and I am glad it was free and I did not spend any money to try. I followed usage directions yet it left a huge film all over EVERYTHING in my dishwashing load. I had to rewash everything with my usual detergent. I would not buy this.
This product was reasonable in price but it gave me a rash under my arm that I can't get rid of.
Obviously people wear deodorant to not smell as bad but this deodorant makes you smell 10x worse. So disappointed.
I have used suave for over 20 years it used to be a great product. Recently it's been making me smell like I've never put anything on. Not a BO but sour smell now. Did you guys change the formula would be great if you switch back because you're going to lose a loyal customer.
I have been using this deodorant for the longest, specifically the tropical paradise scent. I loved it! I would put it on in the morning at around 6 AM and it would last until I got home at 4 PM and took a shower. No problems whatsoever, and it was cheap to boot. However, the last two tropical paradise deodorants I bought left me smelling strongly like onions at 10 AM. 24 Hours Ha! It barely lasts 4 hours now. But I'm not one to throw things away, so I'm carrying it in my purse where I have to put it on two more times before I get home. The next time I go grocery shopping I'm definitely spending a little more to get a better deodorant. I don't know what Suave changed in their recipe but they seriously need to change it back before they go bankrupt.
This deodorant is terrible. I will take a shower in the morning, and put this deodorant on after. In an hour or so, my pits smell like rotten onions! I could be in AC the entire time and I would still smell. Plus, when I take my next shower it takes forever to scrub the residue off. Another thing that it does is it stains my pits and white shirts yellow. I will not be using this again.
I received this product free/complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. I have used this deodorant in the past so I didn't even bother using the free sample I received. I have sensitive underarms and suave deodorants are one of the many brands that break me out. Not to mention that the powder smell doesn't mix well with my natural scent. I have nothing against this product I just know it isn't for me! :-(
The coverage was nice, however, the deodorant left chunks and left marks on my black shirts that I wear for work (I'm a waitress). The scent is nice. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
What have you done I have used this product for 20 years easy and suddenly it is not working. The last time I restocked something has changed. Please go back to whatever recipe you were using before. I will not be buying this product again.
i tried it just to have Something to use after royal blue great lash has been IMPOSSIBLE to find do not like it at all ! whats the difference between black and glam black
This has got to be the worst mascara I've ever used. It barely gave me any length or volume. Bottom line, don't buy this. Just don't. For me. Please
i'm not a big fan of the shape of the wand on this mascara. it was hard for me to use and i didnt like how it looked on my lashes.
Just tried the lots of lashes. I like the mascara itself, but this particular brush is difficult to use. I have tried it for a couple of days now thinking I just needed to practice, but I will be taking it back to store to trade it out for a diffrent style brush.
PLEASE PLEASE bring back the Royal Blue Mascara. I have used this product faithfully since I was in High School. I have tried other brands and none compare to Great Lash. I am begging PLEASE!!!
Although it did give me some volume, it sadly clumped up my eyelashes. I was doing my usual eye routine starting on the first coat and then my eyelashes appeared to be clumped up. Not only that but my eyelashes would not curl ! I was so outraged !
I bought this product and an very unhappy with it, I am returning it to the store!! I apply it in the morning getting ready for work, and within a couple of hours, I look like a raccoon!! Black all around my eyes!! Very disappointed.!!! Not happy !!
WELL I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE MASCARA TODAY AND IT SAID NO CLUMPS. ANYWAYS I TRIED IT ON AND I SAW A LOT OF CLUMPS AND IT DIDNT LOOK PRETTY! BUT I DID HEAR OTHER PEOPLE SAY IT WORKED WELL FOR THEM THATS WHY I SAY IT MIGHT HAVE NOT WORKED WELL FOR ME.
This product flaked as a mascara, provided little coverage, wasnt able to be built up and in general worked poorly. I would not buy again.
When i used this product it clumped, not appealing and the brush is a awkward shape! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!
It only colored my lashes, gave no volume or length, and I had a horrible reaction to it. My eyes itched for several days after trying it. I almost never tried another maybelline mascara. Thankfully, I did try another formula and no issues.
The queen of the mascaras. To bad I stop buying it. I used the Great Lash since I started using make up, but I stop using it for two reasons: i love the blue color and its hard to find in stores and when i do find it is dry and smudgy.
Not pleased at all! Bought this by mistake, wanted original product. The graduated brush does not allow easy application. And, after a day at work, the mascara is flaking off my lashes onto my cheeks. Could not recommend to anyone.
I tried this mascara for the first time and my eyes started burning. I took it off and my eyes were bloodshot. The next day I tried my normal mascara and I was perfectly fine. I wear contacts, but I have never had this happen with the other Maybelline mascaras that I have tried. I don't know if I got a bad tube or what.
sorry but this maskara does not go on well, its been smearing underneath my eyes, i never had this problem before, i get to work and have to wash under my eyes!
Worst mascara I have bought from Maybelline yet. I have three in my bag and this is the only one that breaks after wearing for 2-4 hours. It flakes off and is very stiff. Very unhappy with this one!
Since Maybelline stopped the Great Lash Blackish/Brown this is no improvement on that, It is no comparison . I do not know why you would not have brownish/black still for older woman, even I look washed out not happy at all. Older woman suit brown
I have worn Great Lash Royal Blue Mascara EVERY DAY for over Thirty Years! It works with my fair complexion, blue eyes, blonde hair. I've literally gotten YEARS worth of compliments with this product!! Please reconsider this decision to discontinue
This Lots of Lashes mascara has the worst brush ever - never again will I buy it. It's too small and has a weird circular feature. I wish I had known this prior to buying. I'll never buy it again. It also clumps. :( Now I have to buy something to replace it because this does not work for me.
This formula is very thin and liquidy. The wand is so small and the bristles at the tip are tiny numbs. Don't be fooled by the great price. You will just end up with heavy, weighed down, and clumpy lashes.
I recieved this mascara as part of a gift, and was excited to see it was my old favourite. Imagine my DISAPPOINTMENT when Im greeted with this horrible, tear-drop brush with little to no bristles. It went on super thick, extremely chunk, and didn't seperate my lashes at all. I look like I have about 4 eyelashes when it's applied. Awful.
I had been looking for another mascara since many of the other brands have been flaking and irritating my contact lenses. I picked this up thinking it would be a good product, but it is anything but. The brush is awkward to use and clumps all the mascara on my lashes. I end up looking like Tammy Fae Baker. Also, after half a day of working I end up with smudges under my eyes from the formula. I would take it back if the store took this type of returns.
I've been buying Great Lash mascara since high school, about a thousand years ago! That's why I was SO disappointed when I bought this product and found it was VERY much below Maybelline's usually good quality. It clumped so badly I was almost embarrassed to leave the house with it on. Please take this product off the market so no one else wastes their hard-earned money on it.
I would rate IDR two thumbs down. Everything about this movie was bad.Even Will Smith couldn't make this movie better!!
This is without a doubt the worst movie sequel I've ever had the displeasure to see. As soon as it was over I dumped it in the trash. The only script more juvenile than this was Avatar. Both an insult to one's intelligence. The only positive comment I can make about this travesty is the audio and video were excellent. Other than that rent it before buying before shelling out more money.
I.D. -1996 won 1 OSCAR (Best Effects) & grossed $306 mil. (See at IMDb.com) This dog has lost $50+ mil. Save your money! Lousy screenwriting, poor story-line, and dialogue that should be reserved for a jr. high play.
One of the least necessary and worst sequels in some time.
I was hoping it was more like the original independence day. Not in the least. Very dry. Fell asleep....
First one was enjoyable, second one was painful to watch. Few times i thought about just shutting it off. Dont even waste your time renting it.
This is one of the worst sequels that I have ever seen. Don't waste your time unless you just absolutely want to see big budget Hollywood bringing one of your favorite pieces of nostalgia .
For those who may be thinking that you need this movie just because you own the first one...save your money! This is borderline one of the worst movies every made. I was at least hoping for some entertainment due to the graphics, etc...not even my kids enjoyed it. My 15 year old made the comment that he would rather sit through the movie Lincoln (which is a pretty good movie for those that like history) 3 straight times than to watch this movie again.
We watched the DVD version before unwrapping the 4k movie, so good we didn't! I read some reviews not beleiving it was that bad, but, boy, iwhat a was a wate of time watching ID2. the first one is not the greatest but A lot better than the new one.
Wasn't what I expected. Not even as good as the first one.
I bought this movie on Black Friday for $1.99. Yes, just two bucks and I believe I over paid. The plot is stupid and is no different than the original movie. Almost as bad as Star Trek wanting to do a different Khan movie without remaking Wrath of Khan, when they could have just redone Space Seed and probably better. The only thing worth the $1.99 was the metal case it came in.
I loved the first Independence Day movie. It was a lot of fun. This sequel is a huge let down. They got poor acting results from the few veteran actors that made the mistake of reprising their roles, and almost no acting from the new cast. It is a bad attempt to cash in on the Independence Day name.
That may sound harsh, but I had such high hopes for this film. I could have been great. BUT NO. Special effects were great. All the original actors (except Will Smith) were back = Great. Story line = Horrible. I do not know wither it was the directors fault or the writers fault. Bad dog, Bad dog. I would recommend this to friends an family only as a learning tool on how to waist potential
This movie was so low budget, it was horrible would never recommend
Should have quite with the first one and I see that they may come out with another to follow this one. Not worth the money. Or the time to watch.
We did not like this movie at all. It was hard to follow and definitely not enjoyable like the original Independence Day. Would not recommend it. I'm sad as I had high hopes for it.
They should never make this movie.It is one the worst movie I ever see
We watched the first half hour and turned it off. Cheesy, boring.
So so bad. Just keep watching the first one. Cheesy acting no story.
I don't understand why they waited 20 years to make this, but the script didn't show for it.Lazy writing, good special effect, but Will Smith's absence is evident.
Don't go in watching this movie expecting a repeat of the classic original. Its not. Kinda of dull. Lacking Will Smith's charisma.
I thought this movie in 3d, might make up for the poor plot.I was wriong. Still sucks.
Bad acting. Bad story. Nothing like the 1st movie. The 1st one was awesome. This one no good
Same old same old sequels are all the same not recommended
Bought on sale for a Christmas present. Unnecessary sequel.
Wouldn't recommend this to anyone! Horrible melodramatic acting and there could have a lot more action. Descent story line but could have played it out much better!
This is just not a good movie. Cookie cutter plotting, humor that consistently falls flat and an ending that just seems to be setting up a franchise that should never be allowed to continue based on the quality of this entry. Can't really recommend it. If you feel you MUST watch it, you might at least enjoy some decent sci-fi visuals now and then.
This movie was a waste of time to watch. Felt really over acted
The 1st movie was way better I really didn't like this one
Not every movie needs a sequel. there wasn't one part I liked in this movie.Help me get that time back Please
Independence Day was a great movie. Independence Day Resurgence, not so much. It was as if they wrote one script and stretched it into 2 movies, except that the first one got a plot, storyline, character development and palpable action sequence. The 2nd one got what the first one expelled from it's digestive tract. I kept waiting for the movie to get going and it never happened for me. I will DEFINITELY read the movie reviews before making another movie purchase.
This movie suck so much that I got this movie for 6$
Straight to the point, very few special effects. This makes the last Godzilla seem overabundant in effects. Too much dialogue, uninteresting plot, and it takes forever to get to the issues. I can see why it bombed in the theater.
The original Independence Day is one of my favorite films of all time. It was fun & cheesy with great effects, the characters were great also & you cared. Now this sequel has NONE of the above & I was surprised it was even made. Even the characters you love are wasted. I even found to be quite boring with only ONE destruction sequence. I was bummed watching it & I traded it & never wanna see the movie again, but at least I can still enjoy the first movie.
Good price for this dvd but the original movie was wayyy better!
If you like the 1st movie then just rewatch it, this one is not good, same stuff not as good acting
I haven't watched it yet but I heard it wasn't any good but the price was..
Loved the first one. Had to have the next one and was totally disappointed. Always so hard to make a sequel that lives up to the first movie.
Independence day is a classic movie but in this sequel the movie just ends up losing he grip on plot, acting, direction, everything. Not sure what the director was thinking.
The digital download did not work. I contacted the UV support but the customer service is terrible - they can't or won't resolve the issue. Save your money.
I wasn't expecting much from this movie and as it turned out, I was still expecting to much.
Watching this movie was like (Nails on a chalk board). The directing and acting was terrible. Sometimes I will watch a B movie, but this was almost as bad as Star Wars episodes 1-3.
It is just not that good, I like the first one but like most sequels not as good.I didn't like that China comes to the rescue I suppose that fits the idea of world Independence Day but not so much American. But even if they cut that out it is just not a likable story.
Alas, I was hoping this would be a great sequel, but alas it disappoints. Too much dialog and the action/destruction did not come close to the original.
I originally bought this on sale during Black Friday. I couldn't wait until it arrived to watch it so I rented it on Redbox. So glad I did because the movie was bad. It was cheesy, unbelievable and all around bad acting except for Hemsworth and Goldblum. They did a decent job. I also liked Pullman but didn't like his character this time around. So very different than the original. I promptly returned the movie when it arrived.
Movie did not seem to make any sense to me. To far out weird for my liking. I thought this was going to be as good as the first Independnce Day but was sadly disappointed.
I won't waste any more of my time or yours on this film. Please do yourself a favor and NOT purchase this film. Such as waste of 2 hours of my life!
Well, this wasn't what I was hoping for when I purchased this movie. Turns out that ALL of the halfway decent scenes were in the preview trailers. This movie was extremely predictable and should never have been made. A total Bomb!
With a Swiss cheese storyline and some poor acting, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. If you can ignore the plot holes and wAnt to zone out.....This may work for you
Where the first one had so many great actors this sequel is boring and a waste of time. You have to give a rating for each movie and this one does not even deserve one star. I did not finish watching this one that is a total dud. Independence Day 2 was not worth the investment of the money for even the blue ray
One of the worst sequels to come out in a long time. ID4:R suffers from a terrible plot and ruining everything that was good about the first one.
Did they have to make a sequel? I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time but I figured ok some of the cast is returning so I should check it out and but it was a waste of time
This movie was terrible, filming, sound ,story,acting everything, sucked sucked, sucked
In my opinion, just because a movie is packed full of action, doesn't exactly make it a great movie. If you want a movie that keeps the kids attention, then this movie is it. On the other hand, if you want a movie that has good acting, scenes that make since, and doesn't steal entirely from the first movie, then you may want to keep looking. I don't like giving bad reviews, but if the movie was bad, then it is what it is. It felt like they had a piece of a script, but still tried to make a movie from it. Some actors overacted their roles, while others seem to not even care about theirs. I also noticed that there were scenes that seem like they were just making up stuff as they went along, and there was a lot of unnecessary pausing while they were talking, like they thought they said their line wrong, and was waiting for the director to say, "Cut". ...I mean, why even make the movie if it wasn't complete? Why steal SO MUCH from the first movie? Were they too lazy to come up with new ideas for the second movie? They had the same seven scenes from part one. (Not necessarily in this order):1.) Convoy of people traveling down road, while we watch conflict in one vehicle2.) Fighter jets fighting small UFO's under big UFO, while getting shot down3.) One UFO gets hijacked, to deliver payload of explosives to mothership4.) One person out of their mind, until it was time to sacrifice themself5.) Person gets snatched up by an alien and used as a puppet to communicate6.) Driving real fast over salt flats7.) Major city destruction with lots of deaths ...I really hate that I didn't go to the movie to see it, so I could've saved myself from having to buy it. Maybe one day I'll watch it again, but that won't be anytime soon, if at all.
This is one of the worst second movie. of a serie of I saw in years!!! I waited for this movie hoping to see a movie make sense ,this did not
After 20 years, you would think Roland Emerrich would develop a better story. Not in the case of this movie. The graphics are great but no Will Smith. Just a mess but the action was good. Ill say that at least!
This could have been a great film, instead the follow on story to the first in the series is extremely weak, poorly done. Good acting by Goldblum and Hirsch. The rest of the cast - marginal at best.
This could have been a great film,. Way too much use of non sensical alien creatures. Good acting by Goldblum and Judd Hirsch. The rest of the cast was marginal at best. Very disappointed in this film.
really want to see this movie??? wait till you may rent the movie.
Movie was slow and hard to follow and a bit cheesy. The actress playing the president's "now grown up" daughter, lousy acting.The first Independence Day Movie I enjoyed but this was a disappointment. Wish I would have rented it first.
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I understand the premise of the movie but found it to be way too silly as compared to the original. I enjoyed the cameos to the original movie and the return of cast members from the original. The movie started off well, but then went in a direction that was just too far out. They tried to cram way too much into it .
Loved the first one. In the mood for a good disaster flick. Turned out to have little action, almost no disaster sequences and some of the worst acting ever.
the 3d was fantastic, it looked really good. as for the movie it self, horrible! they tried to make a comedy and not serous. wich was stupid in my opinion should of just kept it more serous.
I sure loved the original, back in the day. Maybe I'm just older now, but this movie was quite silly and almost unwatchable.
The movie has no real plot, I just a stright action movie but none of was really that good. The whole movie sucks pretty much, unless your just looking for a something to be playing in the back ground in the house.
Nothing unexpected really. Might entertain some (Redbox it first).
Everyone remembers the excitement of seeing Independence Day. This movie seems like a far cry from it. Uninspired script meets going thru the motion actors. A very disappointing movie.
Independence Day: Resurgence isn't what I expected. This movie would never make my the list of movies to watch! The first Independence had a better story line to it.
Possibly the WORST sequel I've ever watched.It's no wonder WIll Smith did not want to be featured in this film. Everything feels rushed and lacks any details. The characters are horrible and the original cast is just as bad. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's just garbage.
This movie was a huge Hollywood budget wasted. Just ridiculous. A giant alien shooting a giant gun really.
This movie is terrible. I absolutely loved the first one. Had high expectations for this movie and was very disappointed. I'll never watch it again and now I own it.
I loved the first Independence Day, I re-watch it from time to time. I knew that this sequel had gotten so so reviews, but I though how bad can it be? Well the answer is pretty bad. The screenwriters just basically took the first script and switched a few things and not for the better. Acting is terrible, overacting and juvenile antics.
Although the packaging in the steel book was great, this movie was an awful sequel.
Bought this to test out the new Xbox/4k tv. The movie was pretty, but through the entire movie the girlfriend and I kept asking what was going on, and in the end we were asking why the movie was so awful.
Very disappointed! What where they thinking? This apple fell so far from the tree it left the planet.
Did not like this movie.
At first, this lip balm was OK. There was barely any moisture and not at all lasting. However, the longer I used it, it became drying. After a month of use, this product made my lips crack and dry for a whole week. It was disgusting and did not feel good. My lips felt like snake skin. I definitely do not recommend this product.
I bought this just to try thought it would be good. I used it for a week before tossing it. Within a couple days my lips were as if I was licking them constantly, dry and peeling. I used a different chapstick and they were healed a couple days later.
I would not want to say anything negative about this product, but I do it for advise other people or to see if the same things happens to them. I really wanted to try this product, but apparently contains some ingredients that also contains the EOS lip balms and gives me allergy in the lips. The first symptoms begin with itching and redness on the edge of the lips with just only 2 days of use. I guess is the beeswax that contains both products. I will give a try to A Kiss of Smoothness that doesn't contain beeswax. I hope this helps!!!
This lip care tastes like you swallowed a bottle of perfume and its thick on your lips. Can't stand this stuff and wouldn't recommend it.
OMG, this movie was terrible. I expected it to be bad, but no words for this one...not funny at all...
This movie was stupid and very volger... big mistake buying this trash
This was an awful vulgar movie. Turned it off. Based on ad I thought looked funny, but it was awful.
I'll admit I didn't read the Blu Ray cover in enough detail. This was, well I can only say, obscene. An interesting premise was lost in a continuous stream of swear words. Definitely adult only.
We thought this movie would be very funny - however it was not entertaining all. Mostly just a bunch of cuss words and no humor or plot at all. After it was over both my husband and I felt it was a waste of both time and money. Two hours of our lives we will never get back - LOL
This movie would have been labled XXX if it were not an animated movie about food.
I knew going in it was R rated, but it turned out to be just too dark.Don't know why; I like war movies, horror movies like Alien, etc. Maybe because it's animated I feel it was too dark, again odd since there are Japanese Anime that I like that are fairly dark.It seems well-made and the sound was good, but just not for me.
Not for children and should have been rated XXX...
The humor gets old pretty fast, most funny parts were in the trailer. Disappointing.
not a movie I would keep watching over and over again. but kind of funny
Silly and gratuitous. Not my cup of tea. Maybe for college age.
This movie would be better for a 4 year old if the language was cleaned up. Stupid plot and the only thing that was halfway decent in the entire movie was the ending of it. Save your money
I wish you had a choice for a zero rating! This has to be one of the most crude, juvenile movies I've ever seen! Pure waste of time!
This is a horrible movie, did not find it funny one bit, jokes got old real quick
Movie was not at all what I thought it would be, disappointed.
Neither of us found this movie to be enjoyable and could not make it to the end! Gave it to one of our friends.
very graphic material -- I may never be able to cleanse my mind
I really didn't like it. I kind of expected more. It wasn't entertaining enough! I really was disappointed!
Basically a waste of time. I would not recommend it
This movie was beyond dirty. It was so dirty, it was actually a bad movie. I did not enjoy it much at all. There might have been a part or two that was funny, but for the most part, the creaters were just trying to be as vulgar as they could be.
A complete waste of time. Sausage Party ranks as one of the worst films ever.
Bad movie and should not have purchased. Only reason was heard it was terrible and wanted to see for myself
After all the hype, this was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen. Apparently somebody thought it would be funny to make an adult cartoon that tried to create humor by pushing the envelope with language and R-rated themes. Instead of funny, it just becomes tedious.
One of the worst examples of vulgarity - turned off after the first few minutes
I bought this for my husband and I to watch.This is a movie geared for men. The innuendos begin within the first 15 seconds of the movie and keeps going to the end. The type of humor was to too much for my liking.
I had seen previews and thought this was going to be funny, was very disappointed when watched. After watching once it was donated.
if two wassals ran a pork house in the woods would the woodchuck eat the product of its bowels?
this movie has few if any laughs that are genuine. I bought it hoping that it would be funnier. Just rent it some where.
Sorry I fell asleep But what I did see of the movie was a bit to outlandish. I love Animated movies but this one just didn't cut it.
The overall movie is pretty weak but has funny moments from time to time. Once it started to get somewhat good, it ended.
Could not watch was ridiculous not for the average. Kind of stupid
Was hoping for a laugh out loud movie too watch. It ended up being a movie that i watched thr whole way through and wish i could tell myself in the past to not buy it.
This is the dumbest, raunchiest piece of garbage I have EVER purchased. It is not funny, not even slightly. I feel asleep three times it was so boring. Husband woke me each time so I did not miss the show. I was expecting writing along the lines of "Family Guy", some moderate humor and adult themes. I kept thinking it was building up to something but alas, nothing.
Worst movie purchase of the year. Avoid T all costs
The movie was to crase and crude, the story line sucked and I pray they don't come out with another one.
Disappointed in the plot. Not funny. Didn't live up to the hype!
This movie is vulgar. Never believe the critics review score? Is my personal believe that most of the movie reviews are rated highly by the actors or producers friends? This is not a children's movie nor is it the mass population of adult movie. The trailer does not reveal the filththat is yet to be revealed I certainly was appalled and I've seen a lot of things in my life
I got for free with my purchase of my Ps4 pro. I wouldn't have bought this money.
Toy Story + food + XXX + no morals = this movie!Every other word is cussing, not funny and the end is a *censored*.... Really. No idea how this is ONLY RATED 'R'.
The movie was funny. But it has way too much cussing for my taste. It has appr 160 F*** words, 45 S*** words, and 2 C*** words not to name them all. This movie is no where near letting a child or even a teenager watch. The movie would have been a good movie without all the cussing. I should have known better to open it when it states on the Back of the package (It's a Filthy Masterpiece). Since I ordered it online and didn't see the back of the package, I should have just taken it back to BestBuy without opening it and got a refund. Don't buy it, unless you like movies that every sentence is cussing and most every sentence throughout the movie is a F*** word in it.
Pretty dumbed down comedy, not worth a purchase, I wouldn't even rent it.
Vulgar movie... not for kids, or adults who don't like to see crudeness over done...
I didn't think it was worth the money so I returned it.
This movie is nothing but garbage/filth. Every other word is the F-bomb or the MF bomb. This movie is not worth the one-star I gave to it.
I thought I would laugh, That just didn't happen. I was disappointed to say the least.
I know it was rated R. But very inappropriate for a cartoon movie.
Bought this and brought it home so that my 18 year old son and I could have hard laugh. What a disappointment. He had his friend over and afterwards I asked he wanted the movie, and we all agreed to trash it.
It can't get any worse then this, I can't believe I can never get those minutes I wasted watching this movie, I kept watching thinking it can't get any worse but it does
Movie came free with the PS4 Pro but wouldn't recommend buying at full price. Got some good laughs here and there but probably better just saving your cash and watching it on Netflix or another stream service.
This unit is super quiet! But only because even on it's highest setting, it BARELY blows. You literally wouldn't even know it was on. Pretty useless. Directions for assembly were terrible.
Fan is great, quality of base and neck TERRIBLE. Took 3 trips to Target after initial purchase to return fan. First time neck was defective and would not slide into place, second time the base was defective and would not snap together, third time remote didn't work Finally got it assembled, with great difficulty, base ended up fitting on so power cord runs out the side rather than the back. Could not line up holes to put all three screws in place, could only get 2 in. Fan itself is a dream. Whoever Honeywell is contracting with to manufacture the base and neck is doing a terrible job. It took 3 trips and a total of 4 hours of my time to assemble something that should have taken 5 minutes tops.
If you're looking for a fan that simulates the feeling of a cat breathing on you, then this is your fan. If you're looking for something that actually puts air out, skip this one.
You literally have to sit with fan blowing in your face to feel air. It's quiet and that's all it offers.
I thought this fan was going to be great but...first of all we noticed that when it was oscillating it made a little clicking noise at the end of each cycle. Within a couple of days it was clicking all the time while oscillating but still we were impressed with how quiet it was when we did not have it in oscillating mode. Since the noise wasn't a problem during the daytime we left it turned on and discovered that it is spewing out little drops of oily residue onto the wall and/or carpet behind the fan. Since we mistakenly recycled the box and receipt I suspect we are stuck with this fan that will now only be useful in stationary mode. Very disappointing.
I recommend this fan for small roomnot for big room. The manufacture should suggest in their tec details.Otherwise it works good No noise.
I wasn't satisfied with this product at all. Yes it was quite......but I'm sure it was because it doesn't move much air. Was of $ just go get an old school box fan if your trying to cool off. If u just was a nice looking floor decoration this is for you
Even at the max level this fan mores little air. Brought this fan to use when sleeping to get a cool breeze...even at max level I could not feel any breeze from the fan to my bed <20 feet away. Returned the fan the next day.
I had to return it. The air flow was to weak.i needed a stronger air flow.
Very weak air circulation. poor construction. must say few feet from fan to feel it.
The fan meets the exact description as mentioned in the brochure but it doesn't serve the purpose.
Looks good but no power, barely blows any air.. I would not buy again.
Its a very quiet fan but doesnt have any power even in 'POWER COOL'. It throws very little air, could barely feel it. For the price not worth it at all, will return.
we bought this to replace a similar fan which did not oscillate properly as it was 10 years old. The new fan had a high pitch whine and did not move as much air on high as the old one does on low. Needless to say, we make do with a non-oscillating fan.
I was very disappointed in the strength of the airflow. At a level of 8, I expected much more output, which is what I wanted. It had no more output than my fan. It actually had less. Why would I want to spend more just for a thermostat that tells me what I already know about the temperature in my home. Bought it yesterday, taking it back today!
Despite the title, this is not a heater!!! It is a great fan, but I will be returning it
I did some research before buying this and it was very inconclusive it said it was a heater but it in fact is only a fan.
This item was installed recently and although it says it has double check valves, neither seems to be doing its job. Despite doing a direct exchange (no other parts were changed out), this primer bulb would not pump fuel or pressurize. Fuel can be heard flowing back into the fuel tank when the primer bulb is sqeezed and it would not pump fuel from the tank into the line at all. With the old primer bulb, which cracked due to age, you could hear the check valve flutter when squeezed, which lets you know it is working properly there is no sound whatsoever with this bulb. I didn't keep my receipt, so I'm out the money and unless you keep a receipt for a 14 item, Attwood's 2-year warranty is useless. I have used Attwood bulbs in the past and some work well while others seem to be prone to having this issue. I recommend spending a little extra money and buying a higher quality primer bulb.
Valves inside were nonfunctional. Wouldn't move any fuel. Have had them in the past and they don't last very long. Go through one every year. they tend to crack. Cheap materials
The issue isn't the product. It is with Target's lack of 'full disclosure'. I specifically searched for a set of wireless earbuds that did not have a bass-boosting element. This one didn't have bass boost listed anywhere, not in the description, the details, on the picture of the product. They arrived and there it is, in big bold caps on the box: EXTRA BASS. SO, I will drive to the target store and return them. I'm sure it will be no problem, but the trip is inconvenient enough. So, beware, these are EXTRA BASS.
For me the sound quality is not what's stated at all. You also cannot use them for talking without both buds being in your ear. And the comfort of the ear buds is not there. Oh and no one can hear me when I am talking on them anyway... long story short I really wish I could return them but I didn't use them soon enough to bring back :( total waste !
This was horrible brought it back the next day would not recommend
There is noice over call. I wish I could return back
No noise cancelling whatsoever. No one can hear you
The headset volume was not loud enough. Strong echo while talking to others.
This headphones were horrible Returned them the next day. Strap too long. Poor sound quality. Callers said it sound like I was in a tunnel
Not a great product. They are really hard to hear.
At first, happy with this product, until THEY STOPPED WORKING!! Bought these, at the recommendations of 2 sales employees,,, VERY DISAPPOINTED,,, AND NOT CHEAP,, SHOULDN'T JUST STOP WORKING WITHIN 4 MOS. TIME!!!
Used for phone calls. Others complained that they couldn't hear me.
The ear buds were not very comfortable and it slide around on my neck pulling on the buds
I wouldn't recommend these to anyone that is walking or running as they will not stay tight on your neck
Literally worse than the 4 dollar headphones by walmart checkout lines. They are made from super cheap, super bad plastic that is sharp in weird places. The audio quality is equally terrible. Seriously bad headphones.
Sounded great but on day 3 left side gave out I lost my receipt for it so im stuck with only one side working
Everyone I talked to said it sound like I was far away from the phone as if I was talking under water. It was returned.
If you are buying this item as a present or gift know that the box that it arrives in will have the items description on the outside of the box. This is a Christmas present so I can't yet evaluate the actual product itself but wanted people to know about the packaging it arrives in. I'll write a product review in a few weeks when we've had the time to use it.
In have followed all the instructions, reformatted USB, tried SD card, turned Mic all the way up,etc. In have sent an email to Karaoke USA. I began searching for reviews and there are minimum. I did find a review where they were having the same issues.
I purchased this karaoke for my grandchildren. The fact it had 4 microphone jacks was most important to me. The grandchildren used it for 3 days and when any disc was put in it only buzzed and squealed. I purchased a second one thinking this must be a fluke. Not so, the second one has been used for 1 day and is already unstable. I don't anticipate it lasting a week. Will let you know how long this one lasts. Very very disappointing.
A few good laughs, but overall very boring. I really like animations like these, but this one fell well short. I personally thought it was a waste of money as it had horrible writing and could have had A LOT more story to it. If you could rent this to watch for a buck, you still paid too much!
Very young children may like this movie but it has no serious plot that would hold anyone over the age of 13. I kept waiting for something to make me believe it was not a Sesame street cartoon but it never came
the movie was not entertaining. the dvd was as typical as a dvd could be.
Wow maybe I wasnt exactly ready for this one ... really slow
Not worth what i paid for it. Don't waist your money.
Cute baby. Nice animation. Horrible writing. Few laughs. Struggled to watch through and find age appropriate humor. Can't believe this one made it from the story boards to production. Tulip character was horrendously annoying and the whole story cried out for better writing. Could have been an entertaining story with different editing and more focus on the main characters instead of a hyper bipolar ride that lacks both content and heart. Pass on this one and do something more productive with your time.
why cartoons go viral is the question that boggles most minds of the populace in the very going of cinema
I thought this movie was really stupid and would not recommend it at all
I'd give this movie a negative rating if it were possible. TERRIBLE MOVIE! What a waste of time and money
This was definitely a big let down!d I bought it for my great granddaughter'
Terrible movie.what a waste of $10 dollars. Should have read reviews
This movie was so borning. I get the idea of it but it just plays out too long. For a kids movie about making babies I also found it to be a little scary. I wish i had rented this first because no one has watched it a second time.
This movie was very cute until it got to the end when showed homosexuals receiving babies. We really enjoyed this movie up until the end when they, every so quickly slipped in homosexuals receiving babies. Will not be watching again, and will not recommend any to watch
This movie sucked. The kids were interested at the beginning and end.
Skittles needs to bring back the lime or take the word original off the bag so these kids don't grow up living a lie. Also, lime is the taste of the rainbow

Recently got some of these from influenster in my SpringVoxBox. I liked the way they looked but they didn't last a day. Easy to apply though. Probably be great for young girls.
Received my EverlastingFrench that I got for free from Influenster in my springvoxbox to test out. Beautiful nails, but they are in size Real Short and they don't fit although I am very petite. So,, disappointing. I think the real short would fit a preteen but they may not be interested in the french manicure look probably the fun colors. Thanks
I have not had the same experience as everyone else. I bought the travel size bottle because I take a lot of airline flights. I noticed that my contacts became intolerable during my road trips. I've figured out that the solution (that is the only solution I've bought that has a milky white look) was leaving a white residue on the lens. That was what was causing the serious irritation. I also noticed that after using this cleaner that my lenses would roll up over night and I would have a hard time getting them to straighten out. I believe this has led to significantly shorter life span for my lenses. All in all, I don't see the benefits of this product and would not recommend it.
I changed over from Re-Nu as my eyes were feeling a little drier. I saw the advertising for Opti-Free Replenish and thought as it was also a little more expensive, that it would be better. Sadly I was very mistaken. I tried it a few times but my eyes were extremely dry while using it. I have gone back to using Re-Nu.
Delete that no rub! Had better results with local lens care solution.Before this i used SOLO CARE AQUA and that solution was a lot better than opti free express, it provided me a lot more comfort. With OF express it gets uncomfortable after few hours of using my contacts.
it makes your lenses extremely dry and blurry and it gets worse the longer you use it i have tried this product 3 different times and it has done this every single time i have better luck with my local store brand and renu
The first contact solution I tried was Opti-Free replenish, 8 years ago. Until recently, I had no problems. Two weeks ago I switched back to O-F Replenish after I finished a supply from another brand. Within hours, my eyes went bloodshot red and I was having trouble aligning my lenses properly. I thought it was allergies so I persisted for four days. I bought another solution from another brand, threw out my lenses, and two days later the redness was gone. To verify it was the O-F Replenish I switched back after a week with no problems. Again, within hours, a bloodshot red reaction with blurry vision. I'm done with this product for good, and it seems I'm not the only one who has this problem.
I have been using Opti-Free PureMoist for a couple of years and was satisfied with it. But when I saw what I thought was a new - and presumably improved - product called Replenish I thought I would try it. What a mistake: within a day my eyes were dry and burning. I used it for a few more days to be sure it was not something else. I returned it for a refund from the store and gone back to PureMoist, but now my eyes are so sore I think I'll have to forgo wearing my lenses until they fhave recovered.
I have been using Opti-Free Puremoist for a couple of years now. Went to buy some and did not see it. Saw the Replenish and since the box said 'New' I thought it replaced the Puremoist. I've only used a third of the first bottle and my eyes burn every day - all day long. That's a lot of money to have to throw away. Have to use it until I can get back to the store to buy Puremoist again.
I used to use Complete but they don't sell it anymore in my area. I decided to try Opti-Free and have been very disappointed. I use monthly contacts and wear them for my 12 hr shifts, which has never been a problem before. But with Opti-Free, my eyes would start to get dry after only 4-5hrs. I bought re-wetting eye drops and would have use multiple times a day just to get through my shift, and then when I would get home I would occasionally have difficulty removing my contact as it would stick to my eye. I struggled through like this for 2 months (thinking it was just that particular contact at first and not wanting to waste the bottle) but I have finally had enough. I have bought ReNu instead and will throw out the 2nd bottle from the pack.
This is so far the WORST solution I have ever used. I had a stinging feeling like I had dropped lemon juice in my eyes. Besides the stinging feeling, every time I put those contacts in and then take them out, my eyes have gone so red. Today, I went to see my doctor and figure out what was caused the irritation - IT WAS THE SOLUTION. So I wanted to speak with the customer service, after 10 minutes on hold, it went straight to voicemail. That shows the manufacturer does not care whether the products work as promised. They should put a RECALL on this solution.
I tried OF a few years ago and had an issue with it causing my eyes to be bloodshot. I never had this problem with ReNu. However, I needed solution and the only thing in the house was Opti-Free. I didn't notice any problems right away, after a few hours, my eyes starting to burn and are once again bloodshot. It's been about a day for them to feel normal. Terrible product.
What happened Immediately had problems after the words ENHANCED COMFORT appeared on the new- look bottles. Experienced eye irritation and contact lens discomfort ..there must have been a change in formula. Bad idea..will not use any more.
Frankly I'm shocked by all of the positive reviews here. Other retailers have this reviewed much more harshly, which fits with my experiences. My eye care professional gives out free samples of this stuff whenever I visit. I've tried it multiple times, and each time I get the same results. Red itchy eyes, hyper-sensitivity to my contacts, and blurred vision. I tried giving all of the samples and the large bottles that I'd purchased to friends and family, but they all said they couldn't use it either, so now the bottles end up in the trash. Opti-Free Express works much better, and the Equate Multi-Purpose (about 4 per bottle) works as well as that.
They reduced the bottle size but did not reduce the price.
I regularly use Opti-Free Refresh but bought the Opti-Free Puremoist because the store was out of my regular solution. This solution causes my contacts to gunk up really quickly! I was having to take them out several times a day to rub them clean and rinse them off. I thought it was my eyes for several days and just switched to glasses. Absolutely no problem with my glasses. Next I switched to a fresh pair of contacts. The same problem occurred within hours. It was bad enough that my vision seemed to have changed. As a last ditch effort, I went to the pharmacy bought a bottle of my regular Opti-Free Replenish. Cleaned my contacts, let them soak for a bit rinsed them off. It took a few cycles of rinsing, but after that there were no more problems. I will never use the Puremoist again. An expensive lesson because I cannot find the receipt. I trusted the brand and never thought there would be such a severe problem switching from one version to a supposedly better version. I'm very disappointed with the Puremoist. On the other hand, I'm very happy with the Replenish.
I have used many brand on the market, including several other Alcon Opti-free products (including the Replenish line), with no issues. I never have eye infections as well. However, two days into using the Puremoist lens solution, my eyes became severely bloodshot and itchy. I went to the optometrist and stopped using the PureMoist and wearing lenses. After my eyes cleared up (which took over a week), I tried the PureMoist solution again, and within hours my eyes became very bloodshot and uncomfortable again. I immediately stopped using PureMoist, and it took many days for my eyes to no longer be bloodshot. They were still uncomfortable however, as if there was dull painful pressure in one eye, so I went to the optometrist again who saw that I had developed an edema (swelling). I now have to take prescription drops and visit an opthamologist for followup.
I used this solution with my contacts for the past two weeks and have suffered terrible bloodshot eyes like never before. I thought I was suffering from seasonal allergies at first so I took a break from contacts for a week. Wore them for one evening and when I went to take them out my eyes were so red it looked like I had poked something into them. I used some red eye drops which helped for a bit, but the redness came back after wearing them again the next day. I finally realized the issue started when I switched to this solution. I have worn contacts for years and never had an issue like this. I'm switching back to BioTrue which has never given me an issue. I would strongly caution anyone from using this stuff, even if you've never had an issue before.
I have used contacts lenses for more than 15 years. I've been using this product for two weeks, as an alternative for my usual brand which was out of stock that day. I had to stop its use yesterday cause I felt like paper inside my eyes. I start to use my new contacts two days ago and it felt like if they were one year old. I'm sorry I spend almost 30 in this product, I had to go back to mine and today I feel my eyes normal again. So it was definitively this product that was bad for me. and I don't have even sensitive eyes.
I bought Opti-Free Puremoist instead of my usual Opti-Free Replenish solution based on product description I read on the box. After three days of use my eyes started itching and burning. I thought it was my contact lens was culprit and replaced it with a new one. But burning and itching has continued. Finally I went back and purchased my faithful Opti-Free Replenish and after first use itching and burning disappeared immediately. Buyer beware Opti-Free Puremoist is not a replacement for Opti-Free Replenish!
I purchased optifree purmoist. My eyes became red and inflamed. Thought it was due to seasonal allergies. Stopped using it and my eyes cleared up. Started using it again...eyes burned red. Used a different solution on one lens...that eye didn't turn red...the eye I used optifree purmoist on is burning and red. Am returning product to Costco....sticking with cheap Costco brand solution. My eyes are too important to be ruined.
I have used the Puremoist product for several months with no issues until recently. My eyes were bloodshoot and irritated. After some trial and error, I determined it was the Puremoist product. Tried another bottle, thinking it was a bad batch, but still had irritation. Can no longer use this product.
I switched to this solution from Opti-Free Replenish and started having trouble with dry, burning eyes. Having had such good luck with Opti-Free contact solution in the past, I continued using it for several weeks as I tried different contact lenses, wondered if I had an eye infection, etc., but eventually the common denominator proved to be the solution. I switched back to Replenish and everything went back to normal in a couple of days.
Having used Opti-free replenish for years without trouble, i bought Opti-free moist and find I cannot use it. On wetting my lenses with it before insertion, after insertion my eyes felt as though they had had salt rubbed unto them. I had to remove the lenses after 5 minutes as my eyes were streaming and were sore for the rest of the day. A friend also had the same problem.
I bought Opti-Free PureMoist and my eyes became red and irritated. It took over a week and a visit to the eye doctors to realize why my eyes were bloodshot. When I stopped using this solution, my eyes finally went back to normal.
Causes me to have Red eyes every time I use ithe very disappointed since it feels the best of any solution used.
After 1-2 hours of rinsing the lenses, this product leaves a greasy film in my contact. So I rince-repat, and same. It impacts my vision as my lenses become blurry. This is not a good product.
I've tired this and Opti-Free Pure Moist, and I'm allergic to both. Opti Free not only dries out my eyes, but makes the whites of them extremely red. I ended up at the doctors office thinking I had an infection, but it was due to this contact solution. It took 5 days using allergy eye drops before my eyes were clear enough to continue wearing contacts. I highly recommend using another brand of solution if you have sensitive eyes.
Burnt my eyes so bad, I couldn't wear contacts for 2 days.
I tried this upon my optometrist's recommendation and because it is supposed to be the improved, updated product of the Opti-free line. Unfortunately it gave me blurry vision while wearing lenses. So I switched back to my faithful Opti-free Replenish that has worked well for me for years!
I did receive 1 bottle but when I ordered, it said a pack of 6. I was disappointed about that. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
While this product probably does leave faces feeling nourished, I would not recommend using it as a daily moisturizer under makeup. It left my face full of crumbles as soon as I brushed on my makeup. Would probably be better as a night cream.
Just didn't have the moisture I am used too. Thought I would try this but will go back to Nutragena

This is a great windex product that I came across after a long time.Please try once and then believe me.
I use to swear by windex and carried it with me everywhere. Now it seams the ingredients have changed. All it does is smudge. What happened
Like so many other, I find that no matter what I do or how I use it, it leaves streaks on the windows. Been doing cleaning for over 50 years. Really not happy with it.
I love Windex!!! Everyone who knows me knows this! However, you guys have messed up perfection. Stop messing up what is already good. Stop trying to cut cost...
This is a great windex product that I came across after a long time.Please try once and then believe me.
I have used Windex forever. The last couple of bottles have left streaks everywhere. Even the Windex that is sold on cloths in packages does this. (So I know it is not my paper towels). Has anything changed in the formula Could it just be Windex sold in California We have lots of regulations here prohibiting this and that. Please help. A couple of years ago I would have given the product an excellent review. Thank you!
I have always used Windex and growing up so have my parents, but lately the mirrors have a cloudiness to them. I though it was because I bought the Ammonia-Free, so then I also bought the Original with Ammonia and it still leaves my mirrors cloudy. Not happy when I am cleaning my house before I have a open house in a few hours.
Why was the sprayer nozzle changed It worked perfect the way it was, now the nozzle sticks in the down position. Takes too long to clean with this, I'll look for something different. I like Windex, but hate the new sprayer.
Windex doesn't clean mirrors, glass like it used to. Leaves streaks. Works somewhat better than last brand tried so bought again. Got home and it won't spray. Nozzle front won't turn at all and nothing else works to open it. I shouldn't have to buy spray bottle for something that comes in a spray bottle.
Maybe i am picky but after cleaning i see a film and cloudy streaky result. I have used this product for many years and don't want to change if i don't have to. Mirrors and windows used to look like new but not lately.
I have used windex all of my life. I have 5 foot windows throughout my home and have always prided myself on the cleanliness of my windows. I purchased three bottles of this windex and everyone of my windows and mirrors have streaks that look as if my windows haven't been cleaned in months. What is the new ingredient in the Glass and More cleaner that is creating this. Maybe you should consider bottling a JUST GLASS CLEANER and stop trying to be everything to everyone. Two days of hard work down the drain and I don't know how to correct the problem. Help
As so many of the other reviews have suggested, it definitely seems as though something has changed. I can't get it to stop streaking. I have used Windex for as long as I can remember for everything. I primarily use Windex original. I'm not exactly sure when I started having issues. Probably the last year or so. I tried changing paper towels and using a clean lint free rag with no improvement. It's been driving me crazy. No matter how many times I spray and wipe my mirrors, windows, appliances and our glass top tables there are still streaks. Disappointingly I'm going to start trying other product.
I have used the Windex glass cleaner for years and year on various surfaces such as mirrors, windows and glass top dining table. But this time when I bought it, it is doing nothing but leaving streaks. My dining table looks dirty no matter how much I clean it and it is not making sense to me. Has something about the product changed or is it the particular bottle This was my go to and now I am having to go research other products. so disappointed
Have the ingredients in Windex window cleaner been changed in the past few years I have used this product for years, but the last few bottles have left streaks on windows and mirrors. Haven't changed my paper towel brand. It used to take only one spray/swipe, now takes several and still leaves streaks. I'm looking for a better product. Disappointed that something has changed after all these years. Please return to the old formula.
Not being a Kind Bar aficionado, I didn't know how widely different each type of Kind Bar is...I expected the same full flavor and fulfillment of the long thin Kind Bars. These are flat, square and rather bland. The dark chocolate adds some flavor but still nothing I was excited about. They do the trick in keeping hunger at bay, but they are not what I expected.
I received this as a sample from influenster. First, let me say I love the smell. It is fresh and fruity and very good. However, when I was rinsing it out, it took all the 'slip' out of my hair and my hair felt pure straw!!! I am sad, because I loved the smell.
I like the results, except I think it's causing my skin to itch like crazy... I'm trying to find out other products you have that might not do that..
I like the way it smells and my hair feels nice after its blow drie however, my hair feels super waxy and oily after half a day.. I tried using less conditioner and same result. I might end up using the shampoo only which is a waste of buying the conditioner.
I bought suave sleek shampoo and used it for about a month, i diddnt like the way the shampoo made my hair feel, like a waxy feeling all over and the conditioner is thick and works decently..i wouldn't recommend the shampoo.
I tried this conditioner along with the shampoo, expecting it to make my hair smoother less frizzy. If anything it did the opposite.
My wife and I have used Suave Professional shampoos and conditioners for many years. We have always really liked how they worked and consider them the best value available when it comes to shampoo and conditioner. However, the Sleek product that is similar to Matrix caused my scalp to break out in severe acne. I didn't realize it was the the shampoo. Nothing I tried helped and it kept getting worse. I finally stumbled on various comments online when I was doing research trying to figure out what was causing my problem that indicated Matrix caused them a similar problem. I immediately changed shampoos and ten days later, my scalp is almost completely clear. Will go back to the other Suave Professional products as their is something in this product that my body reacts to negatively.
I just used this for the first time. It smells great, and was feeling great until I got to my tender bits. Holy wow! Will not do that again. .ow ow ow. Also, they really mean it when they say do not get near your eyes! Packaging has some issues. The top is not attached to the bottle, which made me end up playing catch the lid. Very much like that it's not slippery/slimy like some competitors' comparable product. I love all the other Yes To products I've tried. I think as long as I don't use this on my face and bits, I will like this one, too.
The plastic is soooo dang hard on this bottle that u almost have 2 squeeze the bottle with 2hands... outta line. How can u enjoy a good shower if ur constantly fighting with a bottle of product that suppose 2b nourishing n relaxn. Because of this design flaw i cannot rate any higher. Fix this problem right away. Oh and for the rec'd. i did remove the xtra clear tape on the bottle before use so that had nothing to do with it as some ppl complained.
Johnny Depp did a great job - he is a very talented actor, but in my opinion this movie fell short of my expectations. I didn't realize when I bought it that it was directed by Tim Burton until after. It's the typical weird off-the-wall scattered plot movie. It'd be a one star movie if Depp wasn't in it - he is the only reason the movie was at least bearable to me.
Not one of his best. I should have passed on this one.
I love Johnny Depp in these weird roles, but this one fails to hit the mark. Not really a comedy or a horror flick. Its just lost in the middle.
I was a fan of the original as a child. However, what was fun then is not quite as enjoyable as an adult. The movie is quirky, but that is not enough for me to recommend it. Rent it first.
Strange and familiar at the same time Johnny Depp plays Johnny Depp. Burton uses the same sexually repressed dark figure looking to get it in. See it only once and only if you rented it or if someone already owns it.
This version was too demonic for me. The dog even left the room because of some of the scenes.
This movie wasn't as funny as expected, very boring.
I liked it, but I didn't get pulled into the story. And the best jokes were told in the previews.
If you saw the commercials for this movie, you saw all the funny parts of the movie. I was very disappointed in Depp being in a drawn out pretty boring movie. Borrow it, don't buy it IF YOU have to see it. I give this movie a 6.5 out 10.
I've enjoyed some of Elvis' movies like Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, and Fun in Acapulco. I received Clambake as a gift to add to my collection, and I thought I'd like it especially because it took place in Miami, where I'm from.Sadly, this was not a very good movie. The late-60s styles were comical, and the young days of Christine from Coach and Bill Bixby from The Hulk were amusing. However, the obvious closed sets, corny acting and oddball music interludes kept me asking why was this movie even produced.The final insult to injury... Elvis and his girl drive into the Florida sunset... with mountains in the background! The only mountains in Miami are trash dumps so this was obviously shot in California and poorly passed off as Miami Beach.So I give it 2 stars: one for Elvis and one for the real Florida.
Not one of Elvis's best movies, but it has some good songs in it and parts of the storyline are not too bad. I felt this DVD was not compressed too well, the picture is fuzzy in parts and there are original old-Reel markings in some scenes. The sound is OK but overall it should have been much better quality considering DVD is suppose to be better than VHS.- I would wait for a second release. Thanks.
There are basically four criteria by which I judge an Elvis movie: the songs and how they relate to the movie's story Elvis' acting performance Elvis' co-stars' performance and the story itself.The songs used in Clambake (especially the title song itself) are not well-written. In fact, they are so forgettable that I can't recall any of them as stand-outs. The best one is probably the one (title) he sings on the beach. The song he co-sings while riding a motorbike in the movie is relatable to the story and it does look like Elvis is into the song. However, I think that speaks more to Elvis' charm as a musical performer. Although if you have ever seen Harum Scarum (and if you have not... I do NOT recommend you do), you will see Elvis at his most UNenthusiastic when it comes to singing the movie's songs. The song he sings to/with the children at the park playground is way too long and seemingly filler material... having little of anything to do with the story.As for Elvis' acting performance, I've seen him give worse performances (Harum Scarum definitely tops the list of other Elvis movies I have seen), but I have also seen better (Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, Viva Las Vegas, to name just three). He definitely held his own in this movie. I'll leave it at that. I don't recall any fight scenes in this movie, which I find/found a refreshing change (it's been a few days since I watched it and have watched other Elvis movies since then).Shelley Fabares (if you remember her from the 80s/90s TV show Coach) was likable as the leading lady in this film. Bill Bixby (later most familiar as David Banner from The Incredible Hulk) played the protagonist well because I didn't like him... which was intentional. Will Hutchins (maybe known from his earlier role in another Elvis movie, Spinout) plays Tom Wilson, the waterski instructor whose identity Elvis' character (Scott Heyward) assumes in the movie... is adequate.As for the story itself, it has (for me) two elements I have enjoyed in my own life (motorcycle riding and waterskiing), so I'm probably being more generous about this movie's appeal then I would be otherwise... but that is why all opinions are biased.Instead of outlining the plot, I will just summarize that visually, this movie is more attractive to the eye than many of Elvis' other movies (that have too many studio sets instead of using outdoor shots). Although most of this film was shot in California than Florida, they pulled it off.Elvis' movies, for the most part were make you feel good movies, so to judge this as anything more than that would be doing Elvis a disservice. This film did mark the beginning of the end for Elvis in a number of ways. It was the last film for which he received a guaranteed million dollar salary. He also began overeating prior to this movie and had to take diet pills to reverse the direction his weight was heading. No more needs to be said.If you are like me and either have only a few Elvis movie DVDs in your collection (I have about 10 of his 31) and are wondering which ones are more enjoyable than others, I can only give you a general guideline and that is that most of his better movies were from the FIRST third of the 31. I don't think you can go wrong at all by picking any of his first five (Love Me Tender, Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, King Creole, and GI Blues) as well as Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, It Happened At The World's Fair, Roustabout, and Follow That Dream. I think these movies do a better job of showcasing Elvis' untapped acting potential. I wrote untapped because you could see if he was given better scripts (especially after his first five movies), he could have shown so much more of what he had to offer. Thanks a lot Hal Wallis!Overall, I don't recommend this movie for purchase unless you have to have every movie in which Elvis has appeared.
Being a low price DVD, you do not really expect much, unfortunately though this really goes too far resulting in the VHS version being far better quality. I expect the powers that be thought this film is only aimed at hardcore Elvis fans and corners were cut, this would be the same thought process that managed to produce these calibre of films to start with. I am also surprised that some of the other films in MGM's vaults were not released first, examples being It Happened At The Worlds Fair and Live A little Love A little, especially with the worldwide success of A Little Less Conversation.
Some of the comedy was extreme to the point of not being funny. The female actors looked sickly.
Typical Zac Efron comedy, Anna Kendrick always good. Wedding dates in Hawii
A good fraternity movie without plot, character, and reason but tried to shock.
It looked funny and has its moments but maybe I expected more from the movie but didn't deliver on full humor but raunchy humor.
Thought this movie could be funnier. The previews always show the best parts. And I thought the movie is a let down. They try too hard to be funny........
This movie was cheesy. If you saw the commercial, you've seen the funniest part of the movie.
i like stupid comedy's so it was ok . see it once .
Sorry Zac but you need to take acting classes if you want to survive in Hollywood. Looks fade
I heard this movie was amazing i watched it and it sucked
Not really as funny as previews make it out to be.
there were a few laughs but the story is weak and the language it over the top. Not appropriate for under 17.
I had higher hope for this movie and was disappointed with the story and the jokes. Rent this don't buy it
I was really excited when i bought this movie however was disappointed.
Movie is ok... Not really good and not really bad.... It lost my attention and a day after I watched it, I can not remember 1 scene from it
Raunchy comedy. Much of it not all that humorous unless you're a millennial that sees low value cheap shot political correctness as funny.
not really worth a purchase, maybe not even a rental
A few funny parts but overall not a movie I'd watch multiple times. It's a renter.
Couple of laughs, but typical comedy. Felt a lot like a Wedding Crashers knock off.
What to say about this movie. There were some very funny parts. There are some very explicit parts as well. Not likely to watch again. You may want to rent this.
Progresso had a Meatball and Rice soup last year (2015) that Target carried in the Bay Area and I loved it, kept going back to purchase larger and larger quantities when I ran out. Then the weather got hot and I stopped buying soup. With winter again, I wanted that soup and couldn't find it anywhere. I was so happy when I found that Target.com had it and purchased more than a dozen cans. Much to my surprise, it's not the same recipe! The soup I had last year was tomato based and only had meatballs. This soup is also tomato based, I think. I couldn't quite tell because of how much oregano was in it. And it had chunks of chicken and bits of corn. It tastes so different from the soup from last year! I've decided to donate the rest of my cans to a food bank for the holidays and hope that someone else will like it more than me. Target.com had great prices and the delivery was incredibly fast. The cans of soup were wrapped in heavy duty plastic bags, somewhat wasteful but definitely helpful to prevent spills should any cans unexpectedly get punctured or damaged, although none were damaged. Too bad the plastic bags had some tiny holes in them, otherwise I could have put them to other uses as pet waste pick-up, oh well. So, overall, the soup was a disappointment but the buying experience was good.
DOESN'T REALLY WORK. SUPER MESSY/STICKY.
Of course the first MBFGW is a classic and I did not expect the 2nd to reach that height but still, it was a huge disappointment. The acting, the storyline, etc seemed contrived and forced. Sorry I bought it.
Had a lot to live up to, plus it was 14 years after the original. Fiance and I had a little bad taste in our mouths. Laughed only a few times. Probably recommended as a rental, unless you're Greek.
I did not like this as much as the first one, it was just kind of like a reunion show. It was just ok. I bought the movie for a friend that really liked it.
Not the best sequel but what did you really expect. The original was a breath of fresh air the sequel was trying to get the same breath when we already had the fresh air.
I thought the movie was entertaining, it still focused on family but it was slow in parts.
this movie had nothing for me in it. purchased for a friend and did not enjoy it
Nothing new, if you are a huge fan of the first you might like this. I felt it a waste of time.
my wife loves the 1st movie, she was not impress with the sequel
Saw the first one, enjoyed it. So got the second. Comedy too stupid.
gave it as a gift did not watch the first one do not plan on it
This is a nice basic conditioner. It smells good. It could be more moisturising though. I recently found out Pantene does tests on animals. That is something I avoid whenever I can. I wont be buying. I can easily find the same product without animal testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
When I first got this product I thought that the scent was a bit overwhelming but that didn't translate in the shower or on my hair. My hair is very fine and I don't have a lot so I don't use conditioner as the product just weighs my hair down. Testing out this product was the first time I've used conditioner in a LONG time. The product did leave my hair very shiny and smooth....I loved the feel of my hair. Unfortunately I find this product to heavy on my hair as it ended up flat and limp. I gave up using this product after two uses as I didn't like the look of my lifeless hair. I don't think this product is good for people with fine hair like me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
As for the conditioner I loved the scent it left on my hair. It felt very silky and soft when my hair was wet. But again, it made my hair way to frizzy like I just came out of a wind storm. As long as my hair was wet I was ok, but as soon as my hair started to dry game over my hair had a mind of it's own. I did have a nice shine in my hair and it did smell good, but otherwise it is a no go for me. But everyone has to try it so they came make their own opinion and decide for themselves. Pantene is a great product and I have used some of their other products before, but this one is just not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been using the Age Defy line for about a month now and while I love the smell of the product (and the lather that the shampoo provided) I really cannot give this conditioner a great review. I felt that I really had to use a lot of it on my hair which is highlighted, a bit dry, thin and fine. I ended up finally purchasing a good finishing oil to get a result which I didn't have to do with my previous conditioner. Compared to other Pantene conditioners I have tried, I would give this product a miss. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I did notice it made my hair feel much softer and did notice less hair in the sink but I did find it very heavy compared to what I was using and it weighed my hair down. It didn't help with making my hair look full or the frizziness. All in all, it definitely made my hair smoother and more hydrated but it's not something I would purchase This review was collected as part of a promotion.
So I have to do a second report as a follow up to my first. I have given this product the good old college try but have had to stop using. Although the conditioner makes my hair manageable and soft and the scent is very nice, I experience extreme flyaways after using so much so, that I must go two days (between hair washing) with very little interaction between my hair and a hair brush. I have moved to another conditioner and the fly aways went away. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
My husband and I use Pantene products regularly. This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it. Although this product is not right for me, it did end up being a success for my husband. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I was disappointed when I received this swag I ordered online and will definitely be returning it. First, the color of the sunflowers is more like a red/orange than yellow. Second, the petals on the sunflowers themselves were all bent. I thought they could easily be bent back in shape, but that isn't the case. I could iron them down, but I won't waste my time. For the price, it's not worth the purchase in my opinion. Sorry, this swag missed the mark for me.
This shampoo/conditioner is great the first day.....not so great the next day. I have very normal hair and can go a day or two without washing. Not with this product. I'm very disappointed as this was more expensive than the regular product.
Made our hair feel dry and rough
Tastes way to processed and after taste is horrible, will start making my own.
It is too loud. One of them did not work. Otherwise it's good.
They don't stay stuck on the area above the doors it only remained in place on the sliding glass door.
Limited uses. Product is not good if using multiple full size sheets of paper. Would be good for receipts and things like that. Good that small things won't fall through the bottom of the folder. Folder sections don't expand with the rest of the file folder for thicker files. The major flaw is how thin the file folder is. I use file folders to protect other papers - I want something that will hold up to a lot of handling and tossing on the car seat or on the desk. I don't want something that looks and feels like paper - I want something stronger.
Very flimsy - tears easily not intended for long term usage.
I had intended to utilize this folders for project organization, but the construction is flimsy and they did not hold up. Two suggestions for future revisions of this product: 1) use a heavier weight material and 2)the bottom two sections should be closed from both sides.
The only thing I would change about this product would be to have made it available in a variety of colors.
I thought this would be a great idea for my real estate business. The pockets dont hold alot but the worst part is the main subjext tab is getting ripped and bent. Dont seem to be as strong as my regular folders. Better use for personal filing of home bills or other organizing.
A practical idea, beneficial for occasional projects. Usability though is severely hampered by ridiculously thin stock, making this far too flimsy for actual use beyond file and forget. As an active organizer for ongoing tasks, which the form factor seems to be targeting, it falls pathetically short due to the flimsiness of material as repeated handling is near impossible. Good idea, execrable execution.
I am excited to use this product, BUT the package of 12 was actually only 11. When I'm creating monthly files, missing one is kind of a big deal.
This file wouldn't hold enough for the projects I handle.
Great idea, but this product needs to be sturdier to stand up to the repeated use I give my folders. The paper is too flimsy. I would definitely use it if the paper quality was upgraded.
If paper used was heavier, it would be a great item. However current paper is not heavy enough...if used constantly, not sure how long it would last.
I use this product to organize my business files. I like that I am able to separate my documents in sections. However, it is limited. It would be practical is the left side opened instead. The product is flimsy and does not seem as durable as I expected.
Would rather have a product that was made out of heavier paper stock.
I use it to organize high level visits to my building with many lists and subsections needed. Unfortunately it does not hold up well. Could be made of a stronger (thicker) stock.
This product is a great idea but is not well implemented. The internal partitions are not well thought. The partial divider is really odd and serve to separate sheets but with limited ability to keep things from falling out.
The concept is great, but this product needs to be sturdier.
Too soft. I had to leave it out to get it a bit stale before I could eat it.
unfortunately i didn't like these a lot...still prefer Panda licorice
I couldn't close the cover due to a bad plastic hinge. Closing it by force would break the hinge unless you squeeze the hinge together first. I'm sending it back and look for better quality.
I bought this vaccum on 5-1-11, it worked fine for 14 months and the handle just snapped in half while I was sweeping one day. It was replaced on 8-1-12 after not being able to be repaired. The same exact thing happened last week again, handle broke! It was only 10 months old!
I have had this vacuum for years and really liked it. It is lightweight and it uses premium bags. We just got new carpeting throughout our home. It is plusher than the old carpeting, but by no means a thick shag. I was very disappointed to find we could hardly push this vacuum across it. Auto height adjustment is a joke. I'm now faced with having to purchase a new vacuum cleaner.
The automatic height adjustment does not work if you have plush carpet. I was completely unable to move it across my carpet and had to return the vacuum the next day. It would probably work okay if you have a low and short carpet.
We have owned this vacuum for over a year now. Worked great until we replaced a large room with thick pile, high quality carpet. The auto height adjustment feature does not work properly and continually shuts off the vacuum. In our opinion this is a major flaw and can not recommend this Hoover model.
Liked the large bag - hate bagless vacuums because of the mess. But the handle broke just above the bag and it was 200 for the replacement part. That is pretty much the cost of a new one so no value to that. Went with a cheap bagless figured I would just throw it away if a part broke.
I had the vacuum for 2 weeks before there was a problem with the electrical. There were spark-type flashes coming from the base and then it just stopped any suction and would not work. In addition the bags are much more expensive than other bags so overall I would not recommend this product.
I had the same experience as GAK2010. The vacuum power light would flash, then the vacuum would turn off. The check bag light never went on, but I discovered the bag was 3/4 full. I changed the bag and also pulled a thread and some dust clogs from the brush. It than ran for about 20 minutes then repeated the problem. I took it to a vacuum repair shop and he cleaned it out thoroughly. 42 later, it continued to shut off. I did not take it t the authorized dealer because he has a terrible reputation, and does not even sell Hoovers. I called Hoover and they suggested I clean the filter under the bag. Didn't solve the problem!
I thought I was getting a good vacuum based on reviews I read and b/c I had a Hoover previously that lasted 15+ years, but I'm extremely disappointed. I am having to take this vacuum into the repair shop for the second time in 2 years! The first was because the power kept shutting off by itself and now because the entire handle broke off (and I am just doing regular vacuuming on regular carpet). Sure, there is a 5 year warranty, but the service centers are not convenient in any way. Other things I dislike about the vacuum is that it does not adjust to carpet height, and the power button is located in the worst place. Also, the canister is very loud and the hose continually comes out as I'm vacuuming b/c it doesn't have good latch to keep it attached.
Was very dissappointed. Worked ok on regular carpeting but the sensor that supposedly adjusts from one floor surface to another simply does not work. Looks nice...would have enjoyed the cannister vacuum... but returned it for a less expensive Hoover Windtunnel that works much much better for our needs.
I purchased my Hoover Platinum in Nov 2010 to replace another well known vacuum that I had. I specifically selected Hoover because I had Hoover vac's in the past Hoover has a good reliable name. I love the vacuum however, I don't like having to use a separate vac for tools that's bothersome to me. I've just recently replaced the belt brushroller (easy to do) which I felt was about right for 2 yrs of once a week vacuuming. HOWEVER, I was shocked yesterday when I noticed that the inside of the ergonomic handle was peeling away that was very unexpected for a Hoover product in this price point. Sadly this issue with the handle peeling away bothers me since it now means that this vacuum is not really a Platinum but more like Stainless Steel has reached the end of its life span after 2 years.
Nice vacuum cleaner, if you DON'T have thick pile carpeting. Beater bar does not automatically adjust as stated. Vacuum shuts down automatically on thick pile, high quality carpet. I don't recommend. This is major flaw. My opinion, purchase a vacuum where you can individually adjust the height of the beater bar.
I the Hoover Platinum Collection and was very happy with it. Then one day the on/off switch started blinking and it has not worked since. The motor will run if you hold it at a 45 degree angle but if you try to run it like a regular sweeper it stops running. For the price it should run better. Unfortunately I do not have my receipt, I have the owners manual, but no receipt. Interestingly enough I had an old Hoover Elite Supreme in the basement and that is what I have been using, it still runs:(
We have owned this vacuum cleaner for several years and can say it's wonderful except for one thing.It cleans well, uses bags (why would someone not?) and is very lightweight.The handle has broken off twice, The second time after paying a vacuum repair shop to fix it. Otherwise a 5 star.
I tested four vacuum cleaners. The Dyson DC 41, this vacuum, the shark navigator lift away, and the shark rotator professional. There is not much to say about what I liked about this vacuum. The edge cleaning that it boasts is laughable at best, and the boast about direct air cleaning, also leaves much to be desired, though it did vacuum acceptably. The canister vacuum is virtually useless. It could not even pick up the loose hair from tile floor without me running over it multiple times with that brush attachment. For the price, I definitely expected more, and was sadly disappointed by that name, considering I came from an older Hoover that did its job very well. I settled on the shark rotator pro for it's versatility, price, weight, and vacuuming power.
Being a Hoover Platinum Collection unit, I really expected better performance based on my perceived reputation of Hoover vacuums. Below average suction on floor unit; no on-board tools. Must use second portable unit in package that has hand tools. Bag indicator light on handle of floor unit keeps lighting up as "check bag". Checked bag and it was not full and was installed correctly. I plan on returning.
I have 3 dogs and a lot of tile. I liked the Oreck much better. It did a lot better on the Tile. ... I took the Hoover back to the store where I bought it.
Misleading. The digital that download is only good for one movie in the series.
This series is one of those where you can sit down and watch the whole thing on a lazy day to keep yourself mildly entertained. There are some cool moments throughout the various films, but nothing spectacular about any of them. A guilty pleasure for sure.
Great deal for pretty average movies but Blu-rays look pretty good and I only paid five dollars for five blu rays.
If you are a fan of the Resident Evil series then this box set gives you the first 5 with the nice outer box sleeve. In terms of physical product style, it's cool, basic, but cool. The movies are fairly lackluster in my opinion with the first one being a flawed "okay," and then the second and third one being more B movie fun, before the series becomes unwatchable with the fourth and fifth film.
I am normally in my favoerite store weekly. I needed this product each of those weeks and the shelves were empty. I was forced to order on line which should not have happened. I am a little disapointed but will survive.
The show is unique. I'll give it that. But just not the Sci-Fi show for me.
Overall a cute tongue in cheek comedy, with some decent cinematography at points but alas, it's like they took Expendables and actually tried too hard to not make it another Expendables.. Worth a rent on the dollar list.
Bought this because it was on sale because I enjoy most of the cast. Wasn't what I had expected, but not bad.
its a ok movie but it was a gift for somebody so I just bought it
Hormel added pork to their no beans chili, since I cannot eat pork I can no longer enjoy my previously favored brand. On top of it there were no warning on the label indicating that they had a major recipe change and I can no longer trust this brand. I would love to be able to eat their product, previously it had been my go-to and always in my pantry.
Used to buy this often. Either the chili has changed or my taste buds have! Would not buy again
Runny
This tastes like canned hot dog sauce more than chili. It might be okay on a hot dog with onions, but not for a bowl of chili. I won't buy it again.
Did not care for the taste and too greasy.
I LIKE HORMEL CHILI, BUT, WALMART HAS PROBLEMS WITH CANNED GOODS. BUY IT AT THE STORE. BIG TIME DENTS.
For my personal preference I won't buy this again, the rice was sticking together and only a few morsels of chicken.
I have only used these once. I prefer environmentally responsible cleaning choices that do not contain bleach which is drying to my skin but I like having something with bleach in the house at all times to use if someone is sick. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I wouldn't trust any other brand when it comes to disinfecting. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love the product. A great value and I know my family is germ free. Will recommend to friends and family. Thanks Clorox for being 1 This review was collected as part of a promotion.
great product I use it all the time. I like the lemon scent the best. it really cleans my kitchen good This review was collected as part of a promotion.
i like the wipes cause they are easy to use and handy to keep in all the roooms in the houw This review was collected as part of a promotion.
it would really be nice if the wipe would PICK UP the hair and dust that accumulates in bathroom rather than just moving it around and leaving it in a pile on the surface you're working on. You have lots of smart people working for you, it seems that you would have already figured this out. thanks HO Cody WY
i love them, their cheap and desinfected really well especialy if you have kids so handdy This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Although I like the convenience of a wipe, there are a couple of things I do not like about this product. The scent does not appeal to me. Also, the dispenser is frustrating to use. Sometimes many wipes come out, sometimes it takes several minutes to get one out.

The new formula leaves streaks on my glass and mirrors, that was the one reason I used your brand instead of other cheaper brands.
Keebler Chips Deluxe Soft 'N Chewy Cookies are soft and chewy, but they lack flavor. We bought 2 packages of these and thought that maybe it was just that package that was bad, but both packages were flavorless. Just wasn't what we were expecting from Keebler.
Bag of flour broke opened the cheese puffs and cheese spread was a messy box. They should never put the flour in with bags of puffs an spread
Very oily. Doesn't smell clean.
Sorry, this product was just not for me. I bought it out of desparation when Lysol stopped adding disinfectant to the all purpose cleaner (which they have since started adding again). Yes, this product did disinfect, but the smell was way, way too pungent for me. I used it to wash down the bathroom floors, the outside of the commode. Days later, the smell still lingered (which would have been nice if it smelled nice). My scrub bucket, sponge, gloves were kept in my cleaning closet and I had to end up throwing the gloves and sponge out. Within minutes it just reaked up the whole closet. Trust me, stick with the all purpose cleaner now known as clean and fresh. It does disinfect and smells nice, which to me is important. No brainer. I'd much rather the house smell of lemons or waterfalls rather than a nursing home.
I just brought five bottles of this product, unfortunately I had to return all of them I could not unscrew the top off the bottle.
It smells bad makes your house stank
PLEASE...Bring blue back...It is the best smelling...Anything else is terrible...PLEASE...Bring blue back.
Bring back the old rhubarb - the new tone is too red.
didn't like the texture nor the toffee shade. it felt like i was wearing saran wrap on my lips.
I love the colors and goes on smooth and even. Unfortunately it doesn't stay on long. Comes on even without eating or drinking. Seems to rub off with speaking.
It was too shimmery and made me feel like I was wearing a child's chapstick. The color was fine but if the sparkle was toned down I would have no problems with it.
my husband bought one for me because he know how much i love those products. Well i hate it !! it makes my lips totally dry, and the color is way too intense, for sure it stayed too long...
I do very much love how this product adds a shimmery look to my lips... it's just that I find it to be too sticky! I don't use it as often as I'd like for this reason. :(
Love the Lip Shimmer feel, but the color I bought (Grapefruit) didn't give me the light pink color I was after. Instead, my lips looked white and pasty. Had to throw it out.
I have used the cocoa lip shimmer for years and I love it, but it has been discontinued. I have tried several of the new colors but have wasted my money as none of these compare to the Cocoa. I know that Cocoa was a popular color because it was always out of stock. Hoping that Burt's Bee will bring back Cocoa soon!!!
I bought this product thinking I would love it because I love the clear regular burts bees, but this berry color easily comes off when you drink anything and if you accidentally get it on your skin around your lips good luck getting it off...it just makes your skin look irritated and red. Not my favorite unfortunately.
As a faithful user (and recommender) of the nutmeg lip shimmer for several years, I was pretty upset to find that my recent replacement was now sticky, with weak color, no feeling of peppermint, and didn't last. Did the recipe change (The label is the same.) Please say I can get the original quality back somehow.
i didn't care for the two colors that i purchased, which i think were guava + rhubarb. they went on like a colored soft chapstick lip balm and i guess i was hoping for more of a lipstick or lipgloss texture. sad to say that i won't be buying these again, although i like the natural ingredients. they were fairly expensive too, considering.
My lips tend to get dry easily and this product didn't effectively hydrate them. In fact, it highlighted the dry ridges on my lips in quite an unflattering way. It was fine appearance-wise if I had just exfoliated my lips, but dreadful otherwise. I ended up having to buy a different product. It's probably good for those with normal lips.
This was a great product, but now the colors my friends and I have used in the past are no longer available.We wasted a lot of time walking the aisles of many, many stores searching for our colors. Why do you do this We have tried several of your other colors and do not like them. I'm giving two stars because of your color choices. Please return to the colors such as Nutmeg and Toffee. My friends and I are currently using other products, but would return to Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer if you added the old colors back to your collection.
I used to be a big fan of Burts Bees, but have recently scrutinized the ingredients of every product I use.I am an avid make up fan with a medical and scientific research background. The ingredient carmine is actually acquired from killing a certain type of beetle. It is a pinkish/red dye which comes from this bug and we put it all over our face. Some people don't really care but I think it's a little icky. Carmine is also has other names, can't recall exactly, like Red 4 and some others. This information is easy to find. I think it's interesting that all of the fruit oils are given their pleasant names however carmine does not say beetle dye in parentheses next to the ingredient name. When I wore this lip shimmer prior to gaining this knowledge, I did enjoy the colors and the conditioning properties. Burt's Bees is a good company, but not as perfect as everyone believes. Better than many others. I have stopped using this product and the many others containing carmine from all brands, including Dior, MAC, Benefit, and countless others.Though it appears that the color radiance is lacking the beetle dye.
when I was a kid, I used to make lip color by grinding up blush and mixing it with lip balm. burt's lip shimmer reminds me of that. there is too much pigment and it sits on top of the lips. not very sheer. so the first application looks ok but if you want to re-apply it builds up and looks thick and uneven. merlot would have been the perfect color, but it was too pigment heavy -- you have to look in the mirror when you apply it. if they eased up on the pigment a little, it would be great. I prefer balms that look like a transparent berry stain, and this is not it. it's more like a dark lipstick. unfortunately, their ligher colors are no better. they're lighter, but they're still not sheer.
I received this for free in exchange for an honest review. Initially this scent booster smells great and quite strong. I used more than recommended because I have a house full of active boys. Unfortunately, the smell did not last long and was not very strong after the wash. Also, the smell is quite pleasant from the bottle, but there is a lingering odor in my laundry room that is not so great. The lingering smell is a bit too `natural` for my liking; Somewhat like an outdoor odor, which is what I am trying to get rid of.
I preferred to have a juicer that uses ALL of the fruits and veggies and not throw away all of the good healthy stuff. This just extracts the juice and the pulp goes in the trash..
The unit functions as advertised except for the gap between the feeder tube and the blade basket that allows large chunks of material to be tossed into the pulp jug without processing.
I believe that this wastes a lot of fruit juice because the pulp is very wet. It takes a great deal of fruit just to product one container of juice (as in the picture). For example, it took 2.5 lbs of kiwi and 2 large apples to product a container of juice. The product is very well made but perhaps juicing isn't in our budget. I am returning this product.
I was excited to try this foundation considering the good reviews and Iman has several different shades to choose from for women of color. I really wanted to like this product but I didnt for many reasons. First of all I bought this one shade too light in Clay 5 and I found out that my shade is an Earth 1. Secondly, it broke me out. I do not think this kind of foundation is meant for somebody with Oily skin such as myself, but I tried Iman's semi loose powder for my other foundations and I have to say that I love it! the powder is great for oil control and it goes on smooth. If you are somebody with normal/Dry skin, then I would recommend this product for you.
Very expensive for what you get, and it's not really that tasty.
Don't like wild rice I guess.
I ordered it thinking that it was what was shown on the amazon site . Its not the same , it was a rice completely different than what is shown. A different color package and rice and rice . False advertising AMAZON.
The smell is very strong and overpowering.
I tried this foundation,,,it goes on too thick and the brush came out of the botter after 3 uses,,,
I like the Visible Lift make up. However, the dispenser quit working with almost half of the product still in the container. It has been a hassel and a mess to get to the make up. Very disappointing.
I was looking for a product with more coverage and liked the idea of the brush and the SPF. This product delivered more coverage but the color is just off. I can't figure out if it is too yellow or orange but I am just not happy with it. It did go on nicely and felt good on my skin. I may try another shade but due to the price, I am not sure. It is cheaper than department store foundation but not whenyou end up throwing it away and having to buy another product. I just wasn't happy with it.
I recently bought the visible lift foundation with the twist brush on top. Foundation is awesome, perfect for my skin tone,,,,,however the pump stopped working after 4 days. I won't be purchasing this again, or recommending it to my friends.
I had my stylist use the product in my hair. After a couple weeks my hair began looking yellowish - greenish. It was very noticeable. I had to cut my hair short to get rid of it. Then when my hair grew back out, tried again. The same thing happened. Looking yellowish - greenish is not nature. People asked what was wrong with my hair.
This is easy enough to use but the color does not last long enough. The color also fades / turns bronze orange in sunlight. I have to use this weekly and its getting expensive to continue. It would be nice to have a product that the color would be more stable in sunlight and last longer. Many of the women's hair color products seem to achieve better results than this product for men.
Would like to continue using this product but it is proving rather expensive. Wrote to you previously about the goldish coloring that follows. You offered a suggestion about adding some peroxide to the shampoo which I have done on several occasions, and starting the coloring processs again but the problem persists. Leaving in a couple of days to go abroad and would like to re-apply Touch of Grey, black/grey. Last application was about 10 days ago but after usual shampooing, not with peroxide, the goldish color remains,even tried leaving it on for about 25 minutes as suggested by another reviewer but still no luck. Do not want whole head covered in black, so touch of grey would be ideal.
I have been using this product for over a year and feel that it is not effective unless I use two applications within two days. The product will fade in the sun and actually turn my hair blond. (I use black )and even with two applications, will fade within two weeks. I'm considering letting my hair go back to grey.
Works best of the products I have tried, though I have not tried the newest product your company offers. Autostop.. However it does not seem to last very long.. and I become lazy on the next application, and the cost involved.
IT is to small of an amount of product to cover my hair and my length is not long at all. The color does not last long enough in my hair. 2 weeks is not long enough to have to keep on redoing it.
But hair colour changes to brown as the dye wears away within a few weeks ...
Hair color changes to a brownish tinge even with the best shampoo and color conditioners
Easy-to-use product looks great after application, but color fades quickly - within two weeks - and hair takes on a funny, reddish/greenish tone.
The process is too much of a hasle. Needs to be simple and quick and the results need to be more natural.
Product needs to get rid of more gray than it currently does.
I live in the middle belt of Canada. This lotion performed well in the summer months. With the approach of fall and winter its performance gradually fell short. I had to mix other oils to try to get the moisture content I needed. Even that didn't work in winter. Those who only need moisturizing lotions for summer like weather will be happy with this. I will not be buying again.
I give it 2 stars because it's KIND bar which I like but the taste wasn't. I thought it wasn't fresh.
After hearing so many people rave about this product, I finally went out and bought this translucent powder and decided to grab the naturally neutral powder as well. I was so excited to use this that as soon as I got home, I applied a little bit of foundation on my face and tried out both powders. Let me tell you.. this stuff is ridiculously strong scented! I could not stand it. After a few minutes of having it on, I had to go wash it off. It started to give me a headache! And I promise, I am not exaggerating. -- With that being said.. If you can tolerate such strong scent on your face all day or don't mind it then this is for you. It does set the foundation and can qualify as a dupe for high end setting powders. As to how well it works or how long it helps.. IDK. Since I couldn't stand wearing it for more than a few minutes. I really wish it didn't have such a strong scent. I would have liked to keep it!
I have seen this product floating around the beauty community on YouTube for quite sometime. And I decided to give it a shot. I was impressed with how it made my skin look at first (I have normal type skin, and not prone to acne). However, I would not buy this product ever again. It has the STRONGEST baby powder smell. It gave me a headache. It made my skin feel dewy/silky as well, like it had a film on it. But maybe that's something others will like.
It didn't really do a lot.. It gets the job done if u layer it..
helps control persperation but I still get undesirable oder from arm pit after a few hours
It is a good product however it is way to sticky. Everytime I close my mouth and open it, my lips get stuck! I also hate having to dip my fingers into the tub everytime and then clean my fingers. Make a Coaco butter squeeze tube that is not sooo sticky!!!!

the tastes is fine of course. they arrived broken and crushed. if you have dipping in mind, purchasing in store would be better.
I used this a few times and I'm not gonig to use it again. The color is not flattering. It smells kind of like alcohol. It's not shiny at all and it makes my lips dry. I was not a fan.
This color was much more red than I expected and it was more of a stain than a lacquer. If that's the type of product you like, then I think you'd be happy, but it wasn't for me.
I'm not really a gloss girl, so I probably should have known I wouldn't be into this. It has a weird texture to me, but then so do all glosses. Not my thing.
I am a lip gloss junkie not a brand loyalist. I tried stubborn plum because it reminded me of a color I used to wear that is no longer available. The packaging is horrible. I didn't know how to open it at first- its a skew top. Then I was not impressed by the applicator. Who's lips works with this flat cotton-swap applicator. Plus the applicator absorbs most of the product, making you go through the color faster. Once I got past the bad packaging and applicator, I was not at all happy with the weird consistency. It was not glossy, kinda like a stain (not long lasting), not as bold of a color I was looking for. Oh well, I will continue on hunting for that perfect gloss.
The shampoo is hard to use, as the bottle is so rigid it's hard to squeeze it out into your hand. It also does not lather very welland so one has to use quite a bit, and then it's still difficult to disperse all over your scalp. I have an itchy scalp and was hoping for some relief, but it does not seem to be working. I was hoping to use it in conjunction withthe hairever pre-treatment.
It's a great product but they are crazy to think I'd or others would pay 89 for a package of two bottles of this stuff. Very crazy indeed, will change products or go without.
I was not impressed. The fabric is rough and doesn't seem to stay in place like I expected.
Although it works well I can not tolerate the smell.
It did not help my dry lips much and definitely did not last long. I will not order this again.
Great pasta but the cheese sauce was a bit waxy, the shells with cheese is a better sauce.
I really wanted to like this lip balm, but the smell is just overpowering. It smells like a cross between VERY strong honey, and very strong fake rose. The consistency is good, the feeling on your lips is good (not too greasy, not too dry), but after about 5 minutes, I couldn't take the smell anymore had to wipe it off. If you don't mind strong smells, then this might be a good lip balm. If you want something that smells subtle , I highly suggest you find a different product than this one.
I used to love these wipes but recently something has changed in the quality of the paper used. They were great for wiping down the table or counter but now there are lots of little fibers left behind. This makes the table look dirtier than when I started and means I need to go back through with another towel to finish the clean up, which defeats the purpose of convenience wipes.

I bought this comforter set last week and i was shocked that the color was not as pretty as it appeared on line .. the gray background made my room look so dark .
If we had not already used this heater, we would have returned it. Bought it to warm up our bathroom before a shower. It does not get warm enough. We put it on high about a half hour before taking a shower & only slightly warmer. This is a small bathroom about 8 x 8. We do have tile floors & a granite top on the vanity so maybe that makes a difference....harder to heat.Suggest buying a bigger heater with more wattage.
They were all crushed when they arrived in spite of the huge box and other protection......not the thing to get in mail, just buy it at the store, nothing worst then a bag of bits and pieces of chips
To be honest, I grew up with an amazing old cast iron wood burning stove and have been pretty spoiled by its longevity and quality. I am now building my own home and needed a medium size stove for my small space. I had done my research and this Pleasant Hearth stove seemed like a good fit. I took careful note of the measurements because my husband and I wanted a firebox big enough for medium to large pieces of wood. We have NOT tested the stove yet as it is still summer, however, just on first inspection, it had some issues...When we went to pick up the stove, a forklift brought it over to our car on what turned out to be a broken (crushed to pieces!) pallet so that when we drove it over an hour to our house, it leaned frighteningly in the back. We would have asked for a different pallet but the stove itself was screwed to what was left of one of the slats. Fortunately, none of the legs were bent.When we got the stove home and unwrapped it, I was SHOCKED at how small the actual firebox opening is! PLEASE NOTE: the picture online and on the box of the stove is seriously misleading: the picture shows a huge glowing fire behind a lovely glass door. In reality, the glass door is way bigger than where you actually stick the wood in so when you are looking at your nice glowing fire, you only really see a small narrow section of it.Another issue that has yet to be seriously tested is the spot welding all over the stove. The big stove I grew up with is welded all around very securely. This Pleasant Hearth stove has all of these weird little spots of welding here and there that I 'm concerned may not stand the test of time.My last major issue with this stove is the coiled wire handles that come with it. There are two of them and the instructions say they should "screw on" easily. NOT the case! My husband spent two hours cranking on them and tooling them to fit.Like I said, we have not used the stove yet. It has not gotten us through a winter yet. I am hoping that it will. Overall, for $800, I wish that it had been closer to perfect.
came with a couple of cracked bricks but they sent new ones out within 3 days. I went through the break in heating and all was well until my first full fire. the paint started flaking off all over the top of it. it was reading 370 degrees with a digital thermometer. exhaust pipe was 310 so even with the vent fully closed as they say to do after it is fully heated.. most of the heat was escaping. not as efficient as they advertise.. it burns on low for a good 5 hrs at the most with a full load of dry seasoned wood. the glass gets dirty quick. its a decent built stove, but it already looks 10 yrs old within the first 3 weeks of operating it. needs to be cleaned a lot and kind of hard to do because you have to lift the brick out of the middle to put the ashes in the pan. decent stove, good heat, but a lot goes out the chimney. the blower is kind of noisy and really doesn't put out much air anyway...it would be great for a cabin or workshop. but as a center piece in your home, I would spend more money on a better quality one. ive had the catylic type before and it was a pain as well. my suggestion is when buying a stove, spend the money. you will only have to do it once and it will pay for itself. decent stove, if it were 200 cheaper I would say buy one of you don't mind a old looking black iron stove. it heats up my 1500 sq ft home. but I have to get up in the middle of the night to add wood and stoke it again. it will not burn for 8 to 10 hrs as advertised.. 5 at the most. you will have coals that are hot after 7 hrs. but that's it. and that is fully closed damper on the lowest setting. it goes about an hr or so on full on heat. kinda like a steam engine. you need to keep shoveling wood in it if you want full heat on a freezing day!!
This was a large bag of Stacy's and they were pretty much all crushed and in small pieces. Expensive crumbs....
The chips were good but he packaging was very poor and they were all smashed up.
Taste was good but most if not all were broken into small pieces
The chips were crushed and crums. What a shame never happened to me before
I order snacks for my daycare center. When these chips arrived in crumbs - completely crushed, I had no choice but to throw them away. Waste of
Chips wereold and had very little taste.
I have been using this gel for years. I am super disappointed in the new formula. The smell is AWFUL and extremely strong!! Go back to the old formula please!!
I had tried all kinds of Gel before I Met my wife in 1999 and Since she had curly hair, she was using your gel and I started to use it too for my curly hair. I had to buy your new gel when I ran out and I was very disappointed with the quality of the new formula, because it doesn't hold or give the wet look the old Gel did. Please bring the old formula back, because I'm already looking for other products to do the job. I don't want to change from your products.
So I have naturally dry coily hair and I honestly have a fear of gels because they often dry white but this one did not! But I didn't get any of the hold effect. I don't know if it's because I didn't use enough(worrying that it would dry white) or if it just doesn't work for my 4C hair. I will try again and apply more product and see if it helps! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I'm bummed!!!! I want they old formula back!!! This new stuff is ok, but the old gel was 100 better. You guys blew it big time!
I have been using this gel for years. I am super disappointed in the new formula. The smell is AWFUL and extremely strong!! Go back to the old formula please!!
The original product was better so, now I will have to look for a replacement.
Go back to the old formula - this new one is not good!
Like all the other posts what happened I loved the old formula... I used it for many years and it worked great. I don't like the new formula or the packaging. Please bring it back...
I have been using this for many years and loved it. However, the new formula smells terrible and the hold is not as strong... what happened Bring back the old formula. I have started looking for alternative products.
I have used the old formula for over 20 years . I am so disappointed with the new one. The smell and hold DO NOT work for me. Can you bring back the old one please
I have used this hair gel for many years and recently Nexxus changed the product, adding a fragrance which is horrible. Please bring back the original gel!
I have been using this product for 15+ years. However, since the recent formula change I am very disappointed. The fragrance is too strong and the hold and feel of my hair is different. I loved the old formula and would have given it 5 stars...very disappointed with the new version.
I finally found the perfect gel for my thick hair. It kept it in place all day didn't flake. Then Suddenly I couldn't find it in any store. I bought the one in the pink tube, not realizing it replaced the grey tube. I don't like it. It's watery, smelly doesn't hold my hair in place for more than a couple of hours. Bring back the old formula.
I have been using Exxtra Gel for 20+ years. I have long, naturally curly hair and it was the best gel that I've found to work well AND I (used to) get compliments all the time on how good my hair smells. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the formula and I HATE the new scent! I've found my hair gets frizzy quicker and doesn't feel as soft after applying gel. PLEASE, PLEASE bring back the old formula... and scent!!
I've been using the original product for around 15 years. I saw the new packaging and thought it was just marketing, however the formula has changed too. I apply this product to my hair before it fully dries, now with the new thinner formula all the hold is gone by the time my hair is dry. Its as if it is mainly alcohol and evaporates away. Hopefully Nexxus will quickly change the formula back due to all the bad reviews, or I will be looking for a new gel product.
I have been using this gel for over 10 years. Up until a couple of years ago it said it had UV protection. Then you changed it. Then a couple of weeks ago I ran out and went to get more and you changed it again. It seems more watery, it doesn't hold as well, and it smells different. Today I went and bought a different brand. I hated to, but the Nexxus isn't what it used to be.
I have been a loyal user of the Nexxus Exxtra Superior Hold Gel product for 10+ years. I've tried other lower priced competitors, but kept coming back to Nexxus based on its performance. However, with this new version doesn't measure up to the old. It's less thick than the older version and the new scent just isn't pleasant ( the older version had a much milder scent).
I have use the old product for 7 years and you recently changed it. It now comes in a copper like tube. I will not buy another one, it offers nothing for my hair type. I love the old Gel. Bring it back. This product is runny, does not offer shine or hold. Not a good choice for thick hair.
I have used Nexxus Exxtra for more than 10 years (even after it was discontinued). So when I saw it back on the market, I had to get it. this new gel is not as thick as the original which is better for today's softer more pliable looking hair. The problem is that the scent is so strong that it makes me not want to use it.
I had used the previous Nexxus Extra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel for years and loved it! Then it disappeared from my local drugstores for awhile then reappeared in a new peach-colored tube. I'm really disappointed in the new version. The scent is terrible and much too strong. The body, hold, and control I got from the previous version was far superior. And to make matters worse, the tube split along the side during the third use. Now I'm looking for another brand. Why did you have to mess with such a great product!
Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!!

Others had warned me, but I went ahead and bought the cookies anyway. The reviews I read were correct - Walmart doesn't pack these well for shipping. Just about every cookie was broken. I will not be ordering these again.
In my work this week we examined and tasted three different brands of cookies (store-bought). The cookie brands were Chips Ahoy, Sunny Select, and Keebler Deluxe. We looked at the physical appearance, the sensory description, and the consumer description. Some similarities of all the cookies are listed below: All three cookies were chocolate chip original. All package sizes were 24. All cookies were dry and crumbly. All have chemical bitter aftertaste. Some differences are listed below: The price is different for all three cookies( Chips Ahoy: 4.29, Sunny Select: 2.49, and Keebler Deluxe: 3.49) Taste Given the information I have found I would not buy store- bought due to processing and unknown chemicals.
Helpful product, every one's should use it.really good one.
A little cooler in color than most 2700K, but the real problem is that they flicker. I'm using a Lutron C.L dimmer with 2 lamps in the circuit. They flicker randomly and a lot. They work fine in non-dimmed fixtures, but not usable in a dimmer circuit.
Bought this to replace CFL 2700K bulbs in a fixture where soft white looks nice....these bulbs are not omni directional (only top half shines) and the color is not as soft as indicated by the packaging. Will have to return for CFLs, apparently LEDs with GU24 base are not yet available in 2700K. If you can avoid fixtures with this socket I would not buy GU24 again. Too hard to find appropriate, efficient bulbs!
I can tell by looking at the container that this will not work. I will have to find another container with a suitable top and put the body wash in it before I use it. Otherwise I would have to set it in the shower without the top, because this top is not going to work.
The vegetables are tasty. The broth is too light for my taste, like eating vegetables in water.
This stuff is very shiny like unicorn glitter. So I guess if you are going for full on glitter face this is your product. But if you are just looking for a light bronzer or highlight this is not what you want.
I was way more excited or this movie than I should have been. Bummer
I'm a huge fan of James Patterson and although few movies are as good as the book, this one was a disappointment to me. I'm not feeling the casting of Tyler Perry as Alex Cross. Ok movie to watch on a rainy day.
Love the smell of this product but after washing my hair in the morning by the afternoon my hair was oily like I never had washed it.
I was using total hair care clear for years. Tried the new formula and hate it. It was the best shampoo ever until it was changed.
I used to use the original Clear shampoo and conditioner and believed it to be a godsend, that's how great it was! My hair always stayed looking amazing and I was able to say goodbye to my dry scalp and flakes. Unfortunately, this new 24/7 formula leaves my hair greasy and flat the day after I wash it. I've also been dealing with an itchy scalp and dandruff. Please bring back the original formula for the sake of the brand and all of these dissatisfied customers.
I used to love this shampoo until you changed the formula. I don't care for the new scent, almost smells musty. My hair doesn't feel as clean with this new formula. The only thing that didn't change is it still makes my hair shiny. However, I will not buy it anymore. Please listen to all these reviews asking for the old formula back. I have not yet found a substitute for the old formula. It was the best shampoo and conditioner.
I used to marvel at how clean and bouncy my hair was....sorry not any more. I am thoroughly confused about what shampoo to switch to. I previously recommended this old one to my daughter and she promptly returned her purchase to me! My hair is over greasy with oily build up, and I am washing it constantly. Flat top is not something to be pleased about!
I have used this product for a long time and loved it. Now it has coconut milk in it, and I can't find any of the clear products in any of the stores. It's so disappointing that I c s nth find it anywhere!! My daughter and I have used total care and we don't care of the added coconut milk, and the scent has changed. Please bring back the original products!! Shampoos and conditioners!!!! I can't recommend these products anymore because we c s nth find them anywhere!!! These ratios g are based on the original products
When I first found this shampoo it was a holy grail for me. I loved it! Since they have changed it, it's not the same. I added it to my shampoo graveyard of things that don't work. Sad, I had finally found something that worked for my greasy hair. Made my hair so soft and manageable I didn't even have to style it. I don't buy this anymore, still in search of something that works as good as this used to.
Started using Clear a few years ago and fell IN LOVE. Have been searching everywhere for the type that I used to use with no luck. Why is there no longer a Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner The best shampoo I've ever used and it gets taken away. I had never received more compliments on my natural hair than when I was using the Clear Volumizing shampoo and conditioner. REALLY disappointed and would love if you could bring that back. For someone with fine, shiny hair, we dont need moisture, hydration. I have tried the color and heat conquerer and my hair never got fully clean and the scent is no longer desirable. HELP! BRING BACK THE BEST SHAMPOO EVER! I will buy it for life. My reviews will be of the current product line as is. This review would be the complete opposite, had the old formula not gone away.
This new formula is not anywhere near as good as the old. The old left my hair smelling great and so shiny and soft for 4-5 days. The new formula softens my hair but not as much as the old and it does smell good after freshly washed but by the end of the next day, smells as if it was not washed for days and is knotted and dry on the ends. Also I was very limited on the type of shampoo/conditioner I could use as some of the new formulas contain algae, cactus, or berry extract all of which I am allergic too, so maybe this hair type shampoo/conditioner is wrong for my hair type, but was the only one I had to choose from due to allergens. I used the old formula for 4 years and it was the only thing that made my hair beautiful and grew from very short to extremely long using the old formula and it was healthy. The new formula doesn't seem to benefit my hair nearly as much. Sad to say but I will no loner be using this product in this formula, please bring back the old formula.
I've used the clear shampoo and conditioner for several years and with the new formula I became completely allergic with a rash from head to toe. I had to go on prednisone for the rash because it was unbearably itchy and raised bumps all over me. Can you please tell me what's in the new one that wasn't in the old one so I can know what it is I have to watch out for. Thank you in advance
This product looked soooo good, so I decided to try the 2 dollar sample shampoo. Good thing I didn't buy the whole thing because it made my hair so oily, dry and just felt gross. It might only be my hair, since other people seemed to have liked it, but I hate it. The one thing I do like is that it has a very good fragrance, but I wouldn't use it again. My hair actually looked oilier than before I had washed it.

Also I was very limited on the type of shampoo/conditioner I could use as some of the new formulas contain algae, cactus, or berry extract all of which I am allergic too, so maybe this hair type shampoo/conditioner is wrong for my hair type, but was the only one I had to choose from due to allergens. I used the old formula for 4 years and it was the only thing that made my hair beautiful and grew from very short to extremely long using the old formula and it was healthy. The new formula doesn't seem to benefit my hair nearly as much. Sad to say but I will no loner be using this product in this formula, please bring back the old formula.
Started using Clear a few years ago and fell IN LOVE. Have been searching everywhere for the type that I used to use with no luck. Why is there no longer a Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner The best shampoo I've ever used and it gets taken away. I had never received more compliments on my natural hair than when I was using the Clear Volumizing shampoo and conditioner. REALLY disappointed and would love if you could bring that back. For someone with fine, shiny hair, we dont need moisture, hydration. I have tried the color and heat conquerer and my hair never got fully clean and the scent is no longer desirable. HELP! BRING BACK THE BEST SHAMPOO EVER! I will buy it for life. My reviews will be of the current product line as is. This review would be the complete opposite, had the old formula not gone away.
I used to use the original Clear shampoo and conditioner and believed it to be a godsend, that's how great it was! My hair always stayed looking amazing and I was able to say goodbye to my dry scalp and flakes. Unfortunately, this new 24/7 formula leaves my hair greasy and flat the day after I wash it. I've also been dealing with an itchy scalp and dandruff. Please bring back the original formula for the sake of the brand and all of these dissatisfied customers.
Love the smell of this product but after washing my hair in the morning by the afternoon my hair was oily like I never had washed it.
I was using total hair care clear for years. Tried the new formula and hate it. It was the best shampoo ever until it was changed.
I used this for the first time last night and my husband walked into the bedroom and said, I can smell your shower all the way out in the garage! Not a bad shampoo, but fragrance isn't haircare. Take it down a notch with the scent.
When I started using Clear shampoo and conditioner I loved it. My hair felt softer and smoother. After a couple weeks, though, I started to notice some flakes. I have never had dandruff in my entire life so this freaked me out a little bit. The only thing in my hair care routine I had changed was the shampoo and conditioner, so I figured it was that, but wasn't absolutely positive. I stopped using it and used Head Shoulders for a few weeks before going back to my regular shampoo. Immediately my hair went back to normal (and was flake-free). After a couple months I decided to try Clear again, since I had a lot left. After about three days I started to get flakes again. My hair is on the dry side, so maybe this makes sense, but as I mentioned, this is the first shampoo/conditioner I have ever tried that caused flakes.
REMINDED ME OF THE GODZILLA MOVIES OF OLD. KIND OF SLOW AND NOT MUCH OF GODZILLA HIMSELF IN THE MOVIE.
This movie was slow to develop, didn't catch my interest through the characters, and in general was disappointing. The best parts were the special effects and fight scenes toward the end of the movie. It's okay for a one time watch.
Not the godzilla movies i grew up on so it takes getting used to. Not a bad movie, just didn't have the kitchy value oc yhe rubber suit and visible wires
It was an OK film. A little toooo long winded. Need to find BETTER actors in these type of films in my opinion.
Godzilla was great and Brian Cranston was great. There wasn't enough Godzilla in it. long and boring not enough monsters.
just another godzilla movie. Not my cup of tea but my husband loves these movies
I'm a fan of the original Godzilla and the efforts to revamp this property just fall short in my opinion
bad plot, not much of a Godzilla movie, bought this movie to add it to my Godzilla movies collection.
Campy and not a must see, unless you are a Godzilla fan.
The story line was very confusing and strange.....
Not very well done. This movie is very hard to keep interested in.
Not bad, could use better directing and more backstory with the types of monsters. The fight scenes were pretty cool, it just took the entire movie before seeing them.
I guess I miss the cheesy black and white Japanese versions of Godzilla from my youth, this was nothing close to that. The newest or relatively closest version of Godzilla that is worth anything is the parody that is mentioned in "Austin Powers Gold Member". The Lt in the movie had way too many close calls and still was able to make it home without getting hurt. And Godzilla saves the day in the end? Really? I dozed twice during the movie and had to wake myself up to finish it. I tried to watch completely, but it is what it is.
the movie wasnt a real godzilla movie. didnt show him enough. the other to monsters were shown a lot more
Movie is good ..... the 3d version looks like a conversion to 3d... really dark in some spots actually hard to see...i would have bought the blue ray if nwe it was this dark.
it was to long no good shots of Godzilla and dark the old was better
I lost interest in the first 15 minutes. Was this supposed to be a continuation of the 1st Godzilla?
Waaaaaayyyyyy toooo much waiting for the giant lizard to show up and cause some destruction, and when he does, it's poorly lit or you only see in tease shots. Not what fans want!!! But it's appreciated that he was treated in a serious manner in this film rather than an excessively campy cheese-fest. No man in a rubber suit here!
I never saw it at the theater. Waited for it come out in 3D. Wished I had not wasted my money in buying it. At least as a rental not that money wasted.
Im surprised how many people liked this movie! It's really not enough of a Godzilla movie for me to recommend. Do yourself a favor and buy the Criterion original or the box set with all the Godzilla movies for the same price!
Where was Godzilla? The movie barely had Godzilla in it. Not worthy.
I was expecting something betterBetween the bugs (bad guys) and Godzilla the main character gets out of context
A very boring and uninspired movie. The film takes forever until you see Godzilla and then it is so disappointing, Rather than make a cool looking monster, you have a computerized version of the man in the suit. The "evil" monsters look ridiculous and the battle scenes are worse than watching the old Godzilla movies.
the movie it self was fine , I guess my expectations of the movie content were not met
Had much higher expectations for this film. Not very good
Pacific rims copy version, everything is not comparable , not going to recommend to anyone of this movie .
I am a Godzilla fan. I wanted to see this at the movie theater but was not able. The story line was very good, what blew it for me was I could not make out all of the night scenes. They were filmed or transfered to dark, only shadows could be seen.
Waited more than 3/4 thru the movie to finally to get a glimpse of Godzilla. Then it was only briefly that you get to see him. Very disappointed.
This movie had some great special effects, but is was really just OK. The premise of a cover up was an interesting way to start the story, but then Cranston is gone and there was not nearly enough action with the title character. It ends up being a weak love story.
Movie was average, had some good action scenes, but a lot of the effects were done on the dark side and harder to see. Was hoping for more of a good "bad" movie, but was just okay. Dialog and story had potential but never really took off.
The movie was awful. Dark, and you didn't even see Godzilla until the middle of the movie. Sorry I wasted my money
The movie could have been much better if the writers and the directors would have focus more on the original Godzilla movie. I was kind of disappointed in the movie all in all.
I kept falling asleep and it took me three times to finish watching it. Go rent it for a dollar
The movie was ok, but not what I was expecting. Would not be a movie I will watch again.
Not the best Godzilla movie. I understand the throwback to early Japanese cinema, where Godzilla would take on another monster jeopardizing mankind but to be honest I started to fall asleep during the last forty minutes. Borrow it or wait until it shows up on cable. Only add it to your collection if you are a big G fan.
Seemed a bit of a let down to have such amazing graphics and action, yet very lacking in storyline. The point of watching a movie has to have some meat to keep the audience interested, seems this one didn't quite follow-thru.
No as moving as the original. Too much of a lot of nothing.
This was a pretty good remake because this movie took more time to develop the story. I was a bit disappointed on the lack of story telling about the star Godzilla but it wasn't bad.
The movie was slow in the beginning but the end was grest
Not at all what i thought it would be,very disappointed.
Movie was not as good as the previews led one to believe. Would not have bought it had I known how dragged out it was.
I bought this for my husband thinking it was a total 'guy' movie and even he said it was just "alright"
The original is still the best because it is "so bad it is good". The action was great of course but it got boring very fast.
Good Movie. A little disappointed in the effects. Every time they showed a monster the picture was dark and hard to make out the details.
This movie was a disappointment. Godzilla hardly appears in the movie. The worst Godzilla EEVVVEEERRRRR. The graphics is what gives it the 2 stars. So if you don't get the Blu-Ray, I'm sorry.
blu ray quality is good but movie is ok,to much talketive scenes
I found the movie Godzilla just OK, not great, not fantastic, just OK. Thought Cranston would have had a larger role.
I had high hopes for this movie and when i finally watched it the movie was a big let down.
I wasn't very impressed with this movie because I felt like it didn't show very much about Godzilla. However we did enjoy the story and great affects.
Movie was not that good (I fell asleep during it). Also movie picture was very dark. I would not recommend.
Good one time movie, I will prefer renting this movie not worth having that on your collection
This movie was really bad story was bad,and you did see enough of Godzilla.
to much and the old movie has better story. to much activety
Thought it was going to be good, not at all. atleast in my opinion.
Some parts of the movie are boring, I don't like much
We've seen several versions of Godzilla over the years, and this one was quite a disappointment. We won't bother watching it a second time.
I didn't like the movie hardly at all... Godzillas roar was lame.. Over all graphics ok .. But the whole story line very weak.. The story took forever to build the characters .. A few scenes I felt were totally pointless ,,,,I thought the father was kind of a little more lost than someone with that intelligence would have been
I had high expectations with this movie but the story line was horrible and the special effects were very weak.
It was 1hr & 26 minutes before you got to see Godzilla for more than a few seconds. Then the main theme which seemed to be Godzilla was too long in coming, the fight was ok but you had to wait for any real action and i had lost interest by then.Very disappointing.Wish i had not spent the money!!!!!
My dishes barely come out clean and I have to re-wash a lot of dishes. Not impressed with these gel pacs.
Needs less sodium. But ok.
Ok, for everybody out there. Stargate is a great movie. If you haven't seen it, you need to. If you have, then you already know what I'm talking about. My purpose here, though, is not to tout a great movie, but blast Lion's Gate for releasing such a poor quality product. I own a good collection of Blu-Ray movies and they all look great on my 1080p Mitsubishi on a PS3. Stargate, however, looks like they ripped a VHS cassette tape and put it on a Blu-Ray disk. Sad. So, for my opinion, I say that your money is better spent on the DVD version. It will be cheaper and look the same.
The "extended cut" looks great. The original cinematography was wonderful. The original music at times gets a bit repetitive, but I imagine that not many people have John Williams talent. Regardless, the most annoying thing about this version is the complete lack of subtitles for the many foreign languages spoken (German, "ancient Egyptian", etc). The only way to get any subtitling (and still much of the subtitles is not there) is to turn on either the English or Spanish subtitles. On the DVD I rented, the subtitles were there just for the foreign languages, leaving the English un-subbed. It wouldn't be so bad, except that this is a Blu-Ray, for which you're paying extra. You expect a little bit of continuity between the movies on different formats. I say, stick with the standard DVD version.
True fans of 'Stargate' will want to bypass this Blue-Ray disc and stick with the much better 2-disc special edition dvd that came out several years ago, had both the theatrical and director's cuts of the film, as well as several bonus features oddly not seen here on this new so-called 'next generation' release.
just start to use couple months ago....so far its good and statisfied......still using it for my baby and for myself too......lets see how it works....good luck
I bought Aveeno Baby sunscreen to use on my son who is prone to eczema. When I used this product occasionally at home, his skin did not seem to break out unusually. However after using this for a week straight at the beach, he had patches of eczema all over his arms and legs. The skin on his entire body felt dried out. While it provides an adequate sunscreen, I cannot recommend this product for everyday use due to the reaction my son had.

I generally LOVE Aveeno products but this one falls short. Babies and toddlers are active, and they rub their eyes, and they cry. This sunscreen, if it gets into their eyes, will have you feeling like the worst parent in the world. My baby girl looked like she was in so much pain when she rubbed her face after I applied sunscreen. She looked so bad that it actually caused an argument with my husband on how I was so terrible at sunscreen application (how could I not be more careful to not get it in her eyes!).
Got in my babies eye and his eyes were watering all day and very red. I felt awful. I thought because it was baby sunscreen I could use it on his face too...
My kids had a reaction to eat. Specially my 18 months old baby, who got a rash and eventually a dry skin peeling. We have been using aveeno products for years, and this is the first time we had any problem with it.
I applied to my 18month old 20min before getting in the pool. It applied smoothly and didnt leave him looking white. However, as soon as he got in the water it ran into his eyes and he screamed and began rubbing his eyes. He continued with red and painful eyes even 30 min after I washed it off. Caution with little ones eyes.
My 2 year old daughter cried with red eyes every time after I put it on her face because she rubbed it into her eyes.
Not a huge fan of this sunscreen. It has a slick feeling when it gets wet and it stung my eyes.
I thought this was working okay until I noticed my daughter was getting tan even when we put it on. I noticed today it rinses right off as soon as we hit the water. What a waste. Get something that is waterproof.Also I just heard the news on cancer associated parabens. Better be safe and use something without them.
too oil
My toddler, with not so sensitive skin, broke out from this sunscreen.
Ugh it Pills up!!!
This product is misrepresented when reading the product details. I bought it because it specifically says sunBLOCK. It is not sunblock though it is sunscreen. There is a difference. Sunblock blocks 100 of the uv rays where as sunscreen only filters out some of them. I would not have bothered to buy this product if the title and product detail hadn't stated SUNBLOCK. With that said I gave two stars because I am using the product on my face and it works alright. However as my daughter is a newborn they recommend sunblock so i have not put it on her, I had to purchase sunblock.
I bought this as it was rated very well but my son's face burned. I even put it on a 1/2 hour before being exposed to the sun and reapplied throughout the day.
My sister bought this because her skin is very very sensitive, even many sunblocks that claim to be organic irritate her skin. She usually buys baby sunblock in order to deal with her skin. Compared to the normal aveeno sunblock, also with 55 spf, the only difference is the smell. The baby sunblock has no smell. However, my sister DID end up being allergic to it even though it says 'gentle as water'. This isn't a big deal to the two of us being that I just took it off her hands and use it as a normal sunblock, but I would NOT rub this on a baby. My sister got totally red from it. Super disappointed here, because she can't find a sunblock that works for her and she burns easily.. but I can't say it doesn't work for normal skin being that I've used it and it does work just fine for me.
Got this for the little man since he doesn't seem to have reactions to their other products. While he doesn't have a skin reaction and it did keep him from getting a sun burn it does destroy his eyes. We have tried to keep it away from his eys but I guess when he rubs his face he gets it in there. No matter what we have tried his eyes always get puffy and red. I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for lotion.
Yuck! Very hard to spread and rub in. We used the Aveeno Face (for adults) and it rubbed in beautifully--this one, not so much. Will not buy again or recommend to anyone.
I had such high hopes for this kitchen cart. I still love the ways it looks, but one of the wheels would not screw in all the way into one of the legs. I tried to swap out different wheels with different legs and it appears both the leg and the wheel are faulty. There is no number to call to get a replacement part. I'm so disappointed! The ability to move was a key feature we needed in a kitchen cart.
I was really excited to receive this cart, the picture looks great and would fit our space well. Unfortunately, the quality (per the price) is not great, and the not all the pieces fit together flush, making it generally unsteady. There are 1/2 gaps between the lag and table where they don't fit together, and the knobs don't fit in all the holes. I would return it to the store, but there would be NO WAY I would be able to disassemble and bring back tot he store in the original carton. I would pay a little more for something that goes together nicely!
this cart looks REALLY nice and the functionality is great. The problem I have with it is the quality. Putting it together was a nightmare, not because it should have been hard but because the manufacturing is poor at best. I had to use a drill to make holes bigger to attach parts because the existing holes were so poorly drilled and didn't match up. Once I got it together I was happy with it and how it looks just beware the quality is pretty awful.
Cd was a little disappointing. Unfortunately Jason has fallen way to far into the bro country trap that has sprung. Used to be easy to distinguish his music from all the other noise on radio but all sounds same now.
My least favorite aldean album, probably gonna just buy individual songs on itunes
Case cracked in 2 places
I recently cleaned out med cabinet and replaced the expired Vicks Vaporub. Huge disappointment. It's like plain Vasoline with a hint of menthol. As the mother of 2 and Gma of 3 we will be trying other products. Sad and miss the Vick's I grew up with.
what's happened to vapo rub i remember growing up as a child, when you used vapo rub at night or during the day the vapors would last longer and were strong enough to open you sinuses and chest and provide better breathing. you guys are really slipping with this weak stuff.
The sequel was not as good as the original. I was disappointed.
This is a cute movie especially if you have little ones at home
Entertaining lots of action packed stunts for the kids
I thought my grandson would like it, but not so much.
Ok, I've waited over a year to write this review. I purchased this chair 12/2009 and have been using it since then about 5-8 times a day. This chair is a decent wood and a decent fabric. The cushions are pretty comfortable actually. The chair is SUPER easy to put together. If you're mechanically inclined you can do it yourself. Others may need assistance from a second person. Fairly easy to wipe down the fabric (covers are not removable). I have fallen asleep in it with my daughter in my arms prior to the squeaking issue starting, so it is really a fairly comfortable chair. What I didn't like: 6-12 weeks after I purchased this chair I started to have a lot of squeaking coming from the bottom bearings of the gliding portion of the chair. This might not be a huge deal for some people, but it's very loud. Especially, loud when you're trying to nurse a sleepy baby back to sleep and it keeps waking them up. I tried to adjust all of the bolts, tried WD-40, didn't fix the issue. I finally contacted customer service at Storkcraft after about 7 months of owning it. They did agree to send me a replacement base for the chair since it was still within the 12 month warranty period. Oh, and I am of normal height and weight, so being over a weight limit is not an issue. Upon receipt I removed the old base, attached the new base exactly as the instructions stated. Again, about 8 weeks after receiving this base I had the same problem. I let it go for about 12 weeks and contacted Storkcraft again just to let them know I was having issues again (even though I was now out of the warranty period). They said that they would as a courtesy send me another base, but any future bases would be at a charge to me. Which of course makes sense. I told them I wasn't expecting another base, just trying to inform them that the problem was not resolved and that maybe there's an issue with the production of the item. I have received the third base (second replacement) and have not installed it yet. I would like to say that this would be a good chair if it didn't have this obnoxious squeaking issue. However, to me that makes the chair almost not usable. It squeaks every single time I rock in it. So I really wouldn't recommend this chair because of the issues I had with it. I did think that everything else about it was fairly nice and definitely worth the price. But that's why I gave it a (2) star rating. Because I wasn't completely dissatisfied(1), but I wasn't neutral on it (3), nor was I happy(4) or ecstatic(5) about it. I read all of the reviews before I bought it and thought it was a good choice, so I thought I'd give my feedback for you to look over as well. Good luck in your decision!
I purchased this item because of the high ratings it received. It is a beautiful chair to look at and it's really inviting but, it is very hard on my back. I thought it was just me but my daughter also found it to be too hard to sit in to watch a 1 1/2 hour movie. Do not buy this chair if you intend to use it for sitting in for long periods at a time.
We've had this glider for just under a year. I wish I would have saved my money for a more expensive set because the quality is just not there - it feels shaky, squeaks, the padding is rather thin, and it just not that comfortable, especially when you have to sit down for longer feedings. It also doesn't work for a taller person - my husband could not sit in it comfortably with our baby. The ottoman also did not work the best for comfortably propping up feet up - it seemed too low and would not stay in place. We ended up just not using it. The glider does the job, but is overall a disappointment.
This lovely rocker has squeeks that I can't stop. I've tried everything...wd40 and tightning all the connections to no avail! Wish there was an answer to this problem. It drives me nuts when I sit in it...it is sooo comfy otherwise.
The chair was easy to assemble was a great piece for our living room. I loved rocking my baby to sleep until it started squeaking never stopped. The sound is so annoying won't go away.
I've had this glider since October of 2009. First 4 months it was awesome, very comfortable, cushions never lose their shape. However, over the last few months the chair has started to fall apart. It creeks and squeaks and clicks. It's just not manufactured to great standards. I have to sit with my butt off to this side, with my left leg crossed while my right leg pushes on the base, upper body leaning to the left... NO JOKE! And at 2 in the morning it is MISERABLE. If my leg gets tired from pushing and I let up a little, SSSQQQEEEAAAAAKKKK! I've almost chucked it over the balcony a couple times!! LOL I do know the chair has a 1 year warranty and am working with them to get the base replaced. But what a hassle!
I love cocoa butter, but I sometimes forget to read descriptions of things and bought solid cocoa butter by accident. I don't understand the benefit of it being solid. It doesn't melt at body temperature the way Shea butter does, so I have to heat it up and melt it before it's usable. It often comes out chunky and it doesn't adhere to skin in its solid state. It takes a reeeeaaaallllyyyy long time to absorb, but it does make my skin soft and make me smell like chocolate, so it's not a bad product. Just an awful consistency.
*Edited to add that the pictures of the ingredients label were not on the page when I bought this product.*This is by no means solid coca butter. It has *some* cocoa butter in it but it's a ways down the ingredients list. It is more mineral oil, petroleum. and paraffin which are the first three ingredients. It is very solid, like a candle. In fact, I dumped the tub over accidentally and the whole thing fell out of the tub in one solid piece. I picked it up and put it back in. It looks like a candle, yellow and nearly opaque. It is very greasy and very, very hard. You can't dip your finger into the tub and scoop some out. You have to sort of scrape the sides to get some of the waxy stuff out of there.On my skin, it is greasy. It has a great scent though I must say. I guess it's cocoa buttery. The fragrance is artificial. I bought this cream for my hands as they are really dry in the winter but this is way too greasy for use anytime but at night with gloves on. It does remove makeup on my face decently although it is certainly not my preferred method. It's not bad on my lips but has a strange taste. I am desperately trying to find a use for this stuff. I think that the description should be much clearer because this simply is NOT cocoa butter at all. It is misleading to label it that way. I have been using this Queen Helene .. stuff on my hands at night and also have used it to remove makeup, on my lips, and also around my eyes for a jolt of hydration but really, I don't know quite what to do with it. It is not what I expected and so hard and greasy. At least it was cheap!
I do not like Greek yogurt.. On par with other greek yogurts. I don't like the taste or the consistancy.
Armor-all version of these wipes cleans stubborn dirt better.
The monkeys are very cute, but the music that it plays is a little off. My three month old daughter loves it, but the music is off key and off tempo that it drives me crazy to hear it.
The hold with this product is great but IT DOES NOT WASH OUT
This does hold but won't wash out even after 3 shampoos. Hair still felt gummy and had to use baking soda to finally get it all out of my hair. Will not purchase again.
I loved it. The ease of manipulation during styling, the hold, the texture, the finish... Everything you want for a piecey pixie.BUT it sticks tenaciously to the hair like tree sap or gum. So much so that it is impossible to wash off. For that, this first try might be my last if I can't find a way to still get back my clean hair at the end of the day.
I wanted to rate it as 3 stars but it will not let me. Has a pleasant scent and is easier to rinse than most other powdered scrubs. It did not cut though the tub ring as well as I would have liked. But over all it did a good job on the lighter stuff. It just needs a little extra something added to help with cleaning tuff stuff.
The shampoo was just okay to me. The packaging and smell is really nice but other than that I didn't see any real difference in my hair. I have quite thick and corse hair to begin with so it may not have been the product for me anyway. I don't have issues with oily scalp but I think people with this problem will appreciate this hair mask more than me.

I purchased this line because it claimed to help oily roots and dry ends. Unfortunately, this conditioner left the ends of my hair feeling extremely dry. I had to use a second product to combat the dryness and frizz. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I received this item free for testing from Influenster. After using the mask, and shampoo, my hair was pretty dry, and this conditioner did not help much. After I dried and styled my hair, it felt like hay! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I received this product from influenster in exchange for an honest review. I used his product after using the mask and shampoo. I found this conditioner very thick and hard to lather. I was not impressed This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This conditioner is fine, unremarkable, but not bad. Pleasant smell. Didn't feel heavy at all. Disclosure- I received this product free for testing purposes. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
My hair usually curls very easily but after using this system I couldn't get my curl to stay the following day and my ends were frizzy- nothing my regular shampoo and conditioner couldn't fix the following day thank goodness. I still used dry shampoo the following morning so this system really wasn't worth it. I received this free in exchange for an honest review. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I received this for free from influenster to review. This would be the best out of all three products i was sent to review from this line. The conditioner did make my curls shine, but i did add coconut oil while i was conditioning my hair. Still would NOT recommend this to girls with kinky curly hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I got this product free and was very excited to try it. I've used it a couple of times now and my hair the day that I wash it is amazing but the next morning is very greasy. I don't like to wash my hair every day. This product boasts that it will prevent oily roots up to 48 hours. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I tried out this whole set.i wanted it to work but the scent wasn't favorable and my hair felt really dry, hard and stiff after and I've always been so proud of my soft hair. I tried using this for a week or so but had to stop in fear that I was causing permanent damage to my hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I received this product as a set free for testing purposes. I used this set as soon as I could get my hands on it. Couldn't wait to use the entire set. The clay mask, the shampoo, and conditioner set are great as a whole but separately they do not work well for me. I have long thick hair and the product dried my scalp out when the mask was not applied first. The product, in my opinion doesn't smell the greatest either. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Received this product from Influenster to test in addition to the pre-shampoo mask and shampoo. I used all three products together and it was too drying even though i have an oily scalp. The product smelled great and I loved the color of the product packaging but overall it was very disappointing and lackluster. Not L'Oreal's best. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I really like the concept of this line and I love the clay mask. However, the shampoo and conditioner combo do not help my hair. It made my ends feel very dry and lifeless. They were noticeably worse than when I started using the line. I have color treated hair and maybe that's why it happened. I would be careful if you have bleached ends using this product line. All opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This was my least favorite out of the three extraordinary clay products. It didn't moisturize my dry ends that much and I had to add on a different conditioner afterwords. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I received this for free in my Influenster vox box. I was so excited to try this along with the clay mask and conditioner. My greasy roots are constantly a source of frustration for me and was hoping this was the answer to my issues. Sadly it was not. I honestly think it made my hair get greasy quicker. Love the concept of the three steps, but simply didn't work for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This was the last step out of the three step process. I will say that this was my least favorite step. The product is designed to take the oil away from your roots and bring moisture to your ends. However, I feel that this brought oil to all of my hair which is why I was left oily later in the day! The smell is great, but I would probably try and use a different conditioner.

I would like to start off my thanking Influenster and L'Oral for allowing me to try these products at no cost in exchange for an honest review. I also wanted to note that I have blonde, color treated hair. Please keep in mind that just because a product does/does not work for me, does not mean it will/will not work for you. Different products work very different on different hair/skin types. Inside the VoxBox was a clay pre-shampoo treatment, a shampoo, and a conditioner. It claims that there are three different types of clays in this system, all which work together to keep your ends hydrated and your roots non-greasy for a minimum of 48 hours. I was super excited to try this and have been trying it for a little over a month now. I am sadto say that this treatment did not work for me. With my normal hair care regime, my hair will stay non-greasy for about two days. If I used the clay system in the morning, my hair would be greasy by either that night, or the next morning. So my hair actually got greasy faster than usual. My hair would also be very very flat and lifeless as soon as it dried. I really really wanted to love this system as I wish I could go longer than my normal two days without washing my hair, but unfortunately, it did not work for me. One thing I did love about the system is that it smelled amazing and the smell would last all day. I am sure this system could work for some hair types, but not mine.

I have been a big LOral fan, using their products for more than a decade now. For the past three weeks I have been testing the LOral Paris Hair Expert Extraordinary Clay range - the mask, shampoo and conditioner. I have curly hair with a normal scalp. I have been testing all three products during my regular hair care routine, but also just the shampoo and conditioner without the mask. After applying the mask which felt weird on my scalp (hard to apply, tangled up my hair pretty badly), I used the shampoo. This did not help too much. I lost some hairs during the shampooing process. At the end I applied the conditioner to smooth my hair, but my hair looked messy, tangled, not to mention that my curls vanishes, my hair was dry, undefined and I looked like I had a stack of hay on my head. I tried using just the shampoo and conditioner without the mask, same unfortunate effect. I have noticed that after only 48 hours my hair was oily and I had to wash it right away - something that never happened before to me - so quite the opposite effect that I was expecting for. In conclusion, the whole system - mask, shampoo, conditioner - did not work for my hair. I am sure they will work for other hair types out there, but for mine these were just unfortunate. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes, but all my opinions are honest and coming from a period of three weeks of testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I had the opportunity to test out this product thanks to Influenster and worked like regular drugstore conditioners. Didn't do much for my hair, I ended up having to use my own conditioner to add moisture back into my hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Despite using this with the line's hair mask and shampoo, I didn't find much difference in oil control the next day and still felt the need to use dry shampoo. It smells nice and made my hair feel soft, but it just didn't live up to all of its promises, in my opinion. Such a shame too because I love the concept and really wanted this to work for me!

I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are mine. I have the most oily roots and dry ends ever. No product I have used can cure it. I was feeling optimistic about this product, but it seems like it is the same as other products. Plus there was no smell, which was kind of disappointing. I have only used it once, so I will update my review if my opinion changes. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The shampoo was just okay to me. The packaging and smell is really nice but other than that I didn't see any real difference in my hair. I have quite thick and corse hair to begin with so it may not have been the product for me anyway. I don't have issues with oily scalp but I think people with this problem will appreciate this hair mask more than me.

My hair usually curls very easily but after using this system I couldn't get my curl to stay the following day and my ends were frizzy- nothing my regular shampoo and conditioner couldn't fix the following day thank goodness. I still used dry shampoo the following morning so this system really wasn't worth it. I received this free in exchange for an honest review. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I received this for free from influenster to review. This would be the best out of all three products i was sent to review from this line. The conditioner did make my curls shine, but i did add coconut oil while i was conditioning my hair. Still would NOT recommend this to girls with kinky curly hair.

I received this product as a set free for testing purposes. I used this set as soon as I could get my hands on it. Couldn't wait to use the entire set. The clay mask, the shampoo, and conditioner set are great as a whole but separately they do not work well for me. I have long thick hair and the product dried my scalp out when the mask was not applied first. The product, in my opinion doesn't smell the greatest either.

I got this product free and was very excited to try it. I've used it a couple of times now and my hair the day that I wash it is amazing but the next morning is very greasy. I don't like to wash my hair every day. This product boasts that it will prevent oily roots up to 48 hours. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I tried out this whole set.i wanted it to work but the scent wasn't favorable and my hair felt really dry, hard and stiff after and I've always been so proud of my soft hair. I tried using this for a week or so but had to stop in fear that I was causing permanent damage to my hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Received this product from Influenster to test in addition to the pre-shampoo mask and shampoo. I used all three products together and it was too drying even though i have an oily scalp. The product smelled great and I loved the color of the product packaging but overall it was very disappointing and lackluster. Not L'Oreal's best. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I purchased this line because it claimed to help oily roots and dry ends. Unfortunately, this conditioner left the ends of my hair feeling extremely dry. I had to use a second product to combat the dryness and frizz. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

The dimensions are only 17 square, not enough to cover our 19. The description claims 18-1/2 so I will have to return them, even though they are otherwise beautiful
The dual to twist on the bottom is very, very difficult to turn. You can't easily twist it to get the right amount to come up through the holes on top. Too bad, because the product works well, but the container doesn't.
Wet...takes too long to dry and doesn't stop perspiration.
n/a
I assumed that by buying a clear deoderant it would go on clear not leave any marks. Wrong! It went on clear goopy,stayed wet for longer than I expected and when it finally dried it left white residue on my black tank top. Also be careful removing the cap. If it forms a suction it will pull out a huge blob and make a mess. Wont be buying this again.
Sad to say, I have been using the Mitchum for Men Unscented for about 40 years... I gave this one a try but I feel the Men's is better as long as you get unscented... I don't want to smell like a man lol...
Easy to use but coverage is difficult and the hair that is covered color does not last long.
too many dark spots too much gray not blending well doesn' stay in
Expiration date of 5-2017 is inadequate for the several bottles of 300 that I ordered. I would likely not use up even 1 bottle by this date
The conditioner was my least favorite product from the new line from Head Shoulders. It left my hair very oily and it seemed forever once I rinsed it off thoroughly. I had to use very little amount of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
While this might work for someone with thicker, coarser hair, it just weighed my hair down and was impossible to wash out. I basically looked like a grease ball the entire time I was using this. Not my favorite. I also think it'd way too expensive for such a small amount of product
This conditioner is not for me as it left my hair dry and my scalp was itchy from this product, I don't know what ingredient it has but my hair did not agree with the product. I gave the conditioner along with the shampoo to my brother and he was fine with it. I wouldn't use it on fine hair yet for people with coarse hair. I have also received this for testing purposes from influenster.
First thing I noticed was the product had a nice appealing smell and I was excited to give this a try. I tried the shampoo and conditioner for almost 2 weeks and my conclusion is that my hair felt like it had a residue leftover even after a good rinse. It almost felt like my hair was not getting clean. I did not like this feeling and discontinued using the product. My husband also tested it so I could see if he had the same issue and he stated that it also left a residue even after the first use. Would not recommend this product. I received this product for free to test and all opinions are my own.
This conditioner smells amazing, but I cannot say it is a good conditioner that can be used alone. I always have to follow-up with a secondary condition because my hair feels dry as though I used another shampoo. I also cannot speak to the claims of assisting the shampoo with keeping flakes at bay, as I saw no difference when using it compared to when I used a regular, deeper conditioner. This product was provided free to me free via Influenster for the purpose of testing and reviewing the product all reviews are my own, non-biased opinions.
Originally I gave this conditioner 1 star because after I rinsed it out my hair did not feel contioned and I had to recondition with something else. I read some of the other reviews and perhaps that is a good thing I personally like my hair to feeeeeeel conditioned when I rinse which is why I give few stars. * I was given this product to try in exchange for an honest review.

I don't love this hair product as it made my hair feel very dry and my hair was itchy. I have fine hair therefore it took away all of my hair's natural oils and made it kinky. I don't reccommend it to anyone with fine hair. I have also received this for testing purposes from Influenster.
Let me start by saying I was given this product to review for Inflenster and I am happy I didn't spend money on it. It completely dried my scalp out and it has taken a couple weeks to get it back to being healthy again. The thing I liked about it was how creamy the formula is, but if you have a sensitive scalp you may want to find out if you can get a sample of this product from the website just in case.

Got the opportunity to try this for free. I got the shampoo and conditioner. This review is for the conditioner. The conditioner smells good but It didn't help with the conditioner part. It left my hair dried out which was a bummer.
I tried this out, and while it smells wonderful and makes my hair soft in the beginning it is too heavy and after a few hours my hair separates and looks oily and dirty. I only use a small amount and I don't put it on my scalp. I'm a licensed cosmetologist and I know that's not where conditioner goes. I did test this product for free, and all opinions are my own.
The game itself, when you actually get to play it, is great. Fun, atmospheric rat-killing. Problem is, on PlayStation, matchmaking is almost always impossible, the game doesn't always run as smoothly as it should, etc. And then, not technically, the progression system (or lack thereof) doesn't exactly beckon you back, accumulating loot too infrequently, and loot for your preferred character even less often. That said, if you've got three buds who're down to play the game's a blast. But a solo player hoping to team up with randoms will probably be disappointed by the sluggish lobbies and worn down by the generally-rough gameplay.
Oxi-Clean great for whites if you want to avoid bleach but you have to be CAREFUL with COLORS. If you put too much or wait too long, it will slightly discolor your some of your clothes. I would recommend testing it first or at least wet your clothes before spraying and then wash them immediately. Also, it doesn't work well with old stains.
This overall product is OK. However, if you are going to sell a product that can eat holes in clothing if it dries on the fabric, it should be listed a BIG WARNING and not burried on line 3 of the usage guidelines. Just saying.
I've used this product for months now. Recently, two different white shirts had a spot on it. I sprayed the remover on it and it stained yellow, 2 of my daughter's shirts that have matching pants. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Help!
I purchased this product in hopes that the claims of defining and building lashes without clumping were true. From the first use, I was fighting clumping. The definition just wasn't there... I'm so disappointed to have wasted the money for this mascara. I would not recommend it at all...
Loved the brush when new. Still feathers my lashes but not as well. It got clumpy. The mascara flakes and dried out within a few weeks. Not worth the money.
it looks super tacky and clumpy . i have wore it about five times only one of those times it looked OK. but other than that , i would never buy this again . in my opinon if you want a great mascara than look in the covergirl section, they have the best mascara.
This has been my favorite mascara for YEARS. But recently 3 of the containers have broken while just opening them. My mom uses it and had one do the same thing recently too... The top seal comes off. I hope this gets fixed because I won't be buying another if it does not.
After being so pleased whith the golden coloured mascara in the volume series, I bought this one. Not pleased with it. The mascara will not stick properly p my lashes, and compared the the one in gold, it does not give med the volume it promises. Only use it as a second coat on top of my other mascara to get rid of it. It is wearable, but not good enough for me. The brush simply doesn't do it for me
It was a great soup but they changed it. Too watery now and not as many lentils. Not worth buying.
I bought this product hoping that it was really powerful acrylic gel. It is not. I used it as directed and it chipped off within 10 minutes of getting to work the next morning.
its not a bad product but it does not set hard at all and keeps having minute bubbles in it. i'm really disappointed
Back when women in business was still a "novel" idea, this movie had a (minor) point. But it's now an antique. Here we have the story of a secretary who wants to be a "player", and pretends to be the boss when her own boss is out with a broken leg. She proves she has the "stuff" alright, but to make that happen the producers have to FILL the room with men who don't see the potential of women, and give her a friend (Joan Cusack) who is an absolute bimbo (to make her look smart by comparison), and give her (a mistake) a female boss who has clawed her own way to the top, and yet HATES another woman succeding on HER turf. NOT very convincing by today's standards.
I bought this so I could hear if someone drove into my driveway. The concept is great. Unfortunately, the alarm sound it makes is extremely loud even on the lowest possible setting. Since this product is a to warn you if someone enters an area it is not made to alarm that person so why does such a sound have to be so loud. My kids even ask to turn it off because it is so loud. There is no option to change the sound either, so you just have this very loud alarm sound as if someone was breaking into your house. When in realty it scares no one but everyone in the house already anyone outside can't hear it so it really is poorly designed. For some reason you can listen to all different door bell rings, so I was hoping I could change the sound to one of those but that is only if you were to purchase the Swann doorbell that goes with this product. If it is used a doorbell the sound is great especially since you can change. Since I installed it, it has rained and stopped working. It says it can be installed outside and can get wet so I'm confused as to why it is not working. Not worth the money. I would research other brands due to the loud sound it makes.
The original animated Jungle Book came out when I was a small child and it still delights me to watch it to this day. My own son (now an adult) strutted around the living room doing the elephant walk when I had it on VHS. Disney now seems to want to do live/CGI updates to all of its classic films. It's as if the kids that watched it back then that now work for Disney wanted adult versions for themselves now. The movie by itself was just okay. I don't think kids will be able to enjoy it as much as the original and really think Disney should leave well enough alone. Some movies don't need to be "rebooted"!
Guess I'm just old and wanted this to be more like the one from my childhood. Wasn't at all like I expected
Being a fan of the original animated movie, it was hard to find the same type of appreciation for this movie. It almost seems that they should have went with human actors since it is a live action movie. The CGI is good of course, but it still seemed to take me out of the moment. Nothing really new or exciting in my opinion.
CGI was great and the opening sequence hooks viewers, but the movie overall lacked the light-hearted and heart-warming Disney magic. I didn't like that Baloo was made a con artist, but The other characters were true form. Get ready for part two.
My husband and I love to watch 3D movies and were sure that Disney would not disappoint us, but it did. The quality was not the standard for Disney, the acting was okay, again not what one comes to expect from Disney. I was a little sad we paid the extra money for 3D since we do have a 4K TV and a 4K player.
Not a bad movie. Some what boring but you can deal with it. Not all movies are great but you know how that goes .
Expected more from this movie. It was ok. If I were a kid I might like it. But growing up on the cartoon jungle book it didn't seem right watching it. It's worth 1 watch.
Doesn't even come close tot the original. Too much green screen. Don't bother
I was really looking forward to a nice mozzarella cheese taste. Instead I got a very bland tasting cracker that did not even have a hint of a mozzarella flavor in it. Then I looked at the list of ingredients to see if mozzarella cheese was even listed. It was--but so far down that the amount in these crackers is negligible, and certainly not enough to affect the taste.Bottom line: These crackers do not have an unpleasant taste, just a very bland nondescript taste. These are not something that I would recommend.
I admit, I have not used this nail polish in over a few months. When I grabbed it out of my nail polish box, the color was severely separated and required me a good five minutes of rubbing it in my hands to get the color to look normal.Putting it on my nails, I noticed the polish was way too runny and often overflowed onto my fingers and paper, even when I made sure to use only enough polish to cover what is needed.Unlike the forty-five minutes it takes to dry my nails with other brands, this polish dried in roughly twenty and didn't really go through that awkward gel stage where it appears dry but is still wet.Looking at my nails an hour later, I have noticed a lot of bubbles on my nails, and my nails really look like I just dipped them in purple paint instead of looking like a salon manicure.Though it was fast drying, there were a lot of quality issues that I have experienced that does not make this product worth buying again.
If you're running low on time and realize your nails need a fresh coat of polish, this product is perfect. However, it will not be perfect the next day unless you use a top coat, which will increase dry time.
I bought this thinking it would dry fast. Well don't get me wrong, it dries faster than regular nail polish, but the xtreme wear dries faster from Sally. It also takes more than one stroke to get a good paint job on the nail. I also found that it chipped the next day. Unacceptable. Won't be buying this again any time soon.
The polish (Peachy Breeze) was easy for me to apply, and looked good when done. I was pleased with how quickly and smoothly it dried (I'm very impatient!). Unfortunately, by the next day, I noticed a couple of chips, and by the 2nd day...forget it! The polish was chipping at the tips and was starting to look funny on the nails.Now I'm having difficulty taking the polish off! Is it my polish remover??Very disappointed with this product.
There was way too much shimmer in this powder!!! The eye shadow did not last on my lids WITH a primer for more than 2 hours
It is okay, but too dark for my taste.
Disappointed it was darker than expected and is Very glittery! Glitter does not bode well with any lines or scars as it highlights and falls right into those lovely features :/. I will say, it was not broken in any way when I received it and came fairly quickly.
Not satisfied with the color or wear is too dull appears like dollar store make up prefer l oreal eye shadow better
For the price, I thought it would be bigger. It's a very small item. I paid too much. Never again!
The browns are more like a copper color the blue is pretty but I got it for ythe Brown's colors for the price its ok
I would recommend just going to the nearest walgreens or whatever to get this instead of risking it falling apart in transit. I can only use the three shades to the right since the main hue is pretty much gone. Buy it in store, people.
I'm very surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this eyeshadow on Amazon, as any other make-up website give this product a mediocre rating at best. I bought 50 Taupe Temptress yesterday. The colors are beautiful in the packaging, but the pigment in the shadow is almost non-existent, and I had to go over my lid multiple times with the middle two colors to get the colors to show (yes, I use a primer, so no lectures, please). The only exception was the last color on the end, which appears black(!), not a deep rose color, when applied. I had a really hard time getting the colors to blend. The applicator is silly skinny, you'll feel like you are using a q-tip. I usually wear Clinique eyeshadows, but this is an expensive habit and I was hoping this would be a cheaper alternative for the quads I normally use. But what is more expensive is paying 9 at the drugstore and not using it at all. I'm so disappointed, I'm actually considering contacting Maybelline to return the product and get my money back. For those that are considering purchasing this, check the reviews at other websites first to get a more balanced view of the product.
Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Plush Silk Eyeshadow, Green with Envy...I was broken when I got it. I like the colors but was not able to enjoy it.
This product is not performing as I expected. I would not buy it again. It leaves my hair feeling greasy.
Unfortunately, what everyone has been saying on here is true. The gummies don't taste horrible at first, but once you chew a little more, the ginger flavor becomes overpowering and nasty tasting. I would say I felt a little more energetic during my workout, but definitely not enough so that I would spend another 14 dollars for 10 servings-worth. You have to eat 3 gummies for a serving, which is absurd and expensive. The Olly woman's multivitamin is AMAZING, so I suggest getting that if you want to try one!
I received a free sample of the Olly Energy gummies to review and overall I wasn't very thrilled with the product. The product does exactly what it says as far as giving you energy but the taste is awful. I have given this product a chance time and time again but I just can't get over the taste of it while chewing it and the bad aftertaste it leaves in my mouth. I don't think I will be recommending this to anyone if I do it will be with the disclaimer of the bad taste.
Package was orange from I am not sure. Was leaking when it arrived. I think using this has also made my face break out more.
In my opinion, it is an over priced yet fair product. I received a very small container sample in my Walmart Spring Beauty Box. Actually, I am very disappointed that such an expensive item would offer a very small amount in a sample. Another customer has posted a review on this item stating she used it for her hands and it was greasy. I don't really see this item as a hand cream/lotion/protectant and to be perfectly frank, this item doesn't really state much about what it is for....other than chafed skin. In the listing it does state something about eczema and since I have that in my eyebrows, that is where I tried the sample of this product, first. All I can say is, a vaseline gel would net me better results and a whole lot less in price. Maybe IF I had received a small tube of this to sample as was the other products included in the Sample Box, I may have been able to try it out for more days and come out with a different conclusion. All I can say is, if you want a hand cream, there are other products that are far less in price that will probably fit your needs better than this product. If you need a product for your facial area for dry skin and/or eczema, there are better products than this and less in price. If you need all over skin care for dryness/chafed skin, the old tried and true vaseline type product in a jar is much less expensive than this. This product does look and feel some what similar as a vaseline jelly in a jar. In regards to greasiness, it is greasy, not overbearing greasy unless you put a lot on but it is in fact some what greasy/oily. I worked in a hospital for many years and in healthcare....if you have much chafing or rash, try AD ointment.
Video is boring and loops around. I thought it had several stories. Kids only watched it one time.
me and my bf watched I fell asleep on it was in bargain bin
This does make my hair shinier and brighter, but the scent is overwhelming. I just condition my ends with it on special occasions. The smell from the bottle is unbelievably strong, no matter how much I rinse, they scent stays. Also, If you have a sensitive scalp, I would recommend keeping this away from your scalp as it makes my scalp very itchy. I would use it daily if it didn't smell so bad. I don't understand why manufacturers put any fragrance in their products anyway. It is a very thick, artificial sort of smell. I wish they made a low chemical, fragrance free version I could use daily.
My husband loves the Voortman chocolate chip cookies, so when I came across these I got them for him to try. He had a few and then started feeling sick to his stomach and didn't want them anymore. He thought they tasted ok, but didn't sit well.
Works great on my feet And on my dry hands I would buy thus product
I ordered this calendar set to use with my son as we complete preschool activities at home. If I could, I would have laminated the entire set first, as that would extend its life a bit. As a former kindergarten teacher, I wouldn't expect this set to last an entire school year. And if you have the children facilitate calendar time with you, unless laminated, these items will tear in no time. :(. The option to tuck each numbered card into its spot on the calendar is nice, but nearly impossible to do without tearing the flap that holds the number card in place (therefore making it useless!). I opted to adhere each number card to the calendar with sticky tack that is removable, but even with that, the cards bend and crease when I gently remove them. If I had access to a laminating machine, I would not use the number cards and instead have my son write the numbers on the calendar with a dry erase marker each month. I chose this set because I liked that it includes a weather graph, so we can compare the amounts of each kind of weather every month (again, I want to laminate that too, so we can wipe clean and reuse each month). I am happy with the price I paid and was not expecting superior quality, so it doesn't bother me that I need to make the set last and handle it with care. Just wanted to give a heads-up to those who are considering it for daily classroom use.
I like the information that this calendar shares (such as What is today What was yesterday etc.) However, it is made of thin cardboard and does not stand up to daily usage.
For me, this is a no-go because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Commonly linked to mouth sores.
I have a zyliss can opener that I have had for years. It opens the can from the top and leaves no sharp edges on lid or can. This opens on the side and leaves a razor sharp edge on lid.
After about 10 uses the plastic handles keep popping loose from the lock position. Noticed a button on the top. I don't know why this is getting rave reviews it's not that good. My next opener will be made out of all metal but maybe plastic on the handle.
The design is great, but it's just a sticker, not a transfer. So it looks cheap, has a glare, and you can see all the clear sticker edges. There are nicer ones out there that look more handpainted.
The product is fine, but Walmart packed it for shipping inside the same box with other things, including 5 bags of chips. It was not inside another bag, and the chips were crushed and the soap was all over everything in the box! I won't order anything like this again. I'll have to get it locally or from a company that knows how to pack things.
I gave it a try but since that all my nails breaks at sesame time. I have very healthy nails so the only changes was using this product. I will go back to Shea butter.
My order was recieved in a pretty timely fashing, BUT when I opend the box, the bottles of soap(I ordered 3 of them) were inside a plastic bag swimming in soap. One of the lids was broken off so it leaked all over inside the bag. At least it was in the bag and not the box, but still VERY messy to open and took a while to clean them up, as well as half a container of soap that leaked out that was wasted. I know this is a good product, I use it all the time. In this case it was the packaging/shipping that was very poor and dissappointing!
Received a free sample in my XOVoxBox. I liked the cleaning power, but I hated the fragrance. The Febreeze was too strong and lingered too long. I felt like I was doused in perfume while wearing the clothes washed in this product!
I was looking forward to trying out the Tide Pods. They do shave a few seconds off of each of your loads of laundry, as you just have to toss them in. The package said that the pods dissolve in any temperature, but I did a hot and cold load with each of my samples and wasn't impressed with the way they dissolve. I was always taught not to put detergent directly on my clothes, so my normal routine is to put clothes into already-soapy water. I watched and waited after putting in the pods (both loads) and it took a long time to dissolve. Even after the casing dissolved, the detergent didn't get very soapy. The pods did get the job done. Our clothes came out clean. While I enjoy the smell of freshly cleaned clothes, I did not enjoy this particular scent (Botanical Rain). It was a strong, soapy smell. I can appreciate why someone would want to switch over to pods, but these simply are not for me. I received these two free samples to try through BzzAgent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I tried the Tide Pods and honestly I wasn't impressed, you would think the more a product costs the better it smells...wrong! I love being able to smell my clothes after I wash them and dry them. I pulled them out of the washing machine and I couldn't even smell anything, they just smelled like wet clothes. I honestly do like the regular Tide Detergent, however, the Pods + Febreze completely fell short of expectations. Like the title says, its great...for a free sample. I'm glad I didn't go out and purchase the product first! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
In my free bzzkit from bzzagent I received 2 packs of the new Tide + Febreze laundry detergent pods so I was able to really try them out. I used them on a day that I had two loads of laundry to do so I really got to get a feel for the smell and I must say, I was unimpressed. I felt that the scent was too strong. It also left my washer with somewhat of a musty smell even after I had left the door open to sit and air out. I used it on the sheets for my bed and for the next two nights I would wake up during the night smelling the detergent smell and wishing that I hadn't! I definitely wont be using these again and I will stick with my usual Tide original detergent! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I did not care for the smell and when i washed my clothes i washed in cold water. I noticed when i was switching the clothes from the washer to the dryer that on a couple of clothing articles the pod didn't dissolve completely and i had to re wash them articles. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
It did what it was supposed to do. Left my clothes clean, soft. It was convenient to just throw in the pod and be done. I guess my only complaint would be Is that the sent is overwhelming From the febreez. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I'm used to liquid detergent that i knew the pods were not for me but it never hurts to try. I dont even know if it even cleaned my dirty clothes. So for me this was a no go. i will not be buying these to me they are a waste of money. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I tried the Tide Pods + Febreze and I must say they aren't any better than the Gain pods I use. I actually prefer the scent of Gain over Tide. The Tide Pods did clean my clothes very good but I don't think I will be making a switch. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
With front load washer the pod can get trapped in cloths and then it leaves behind a residue.
The scent of this product is overwhelming and stays in clothes
Lately the pods are not dissoving all the way and leaving pieces of them on my clean clothes. This really creates a mess when they are put in the dryer.
I like the convenience, ease of use, and cleaning power but I really don't like the fragrance of the 4 in 1 Odor Defense (active fresh).
I prefer Gain and always have. I will continue to purchase Gain both now and in the future. Thank you for the sample, I did enjoy receiving it.
This product does get clothes clean but leaves WAY too much of a strong chemical scent behind. The scent was overpowering and just smelled fake.
I tried these and it was super easy...just throw the pod into my front loaded washer and your done. I only put in 1/2 load into washer, since it takes two pods for full load according to directions. Then just put them in the dryer. When they came out, I did not feel there was anything different. I did not smell anything different. I also used the Gain Pods, and thought they had a much better smell. I did not think they were worth the money I would have to pay. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The fan was great and used only at night to help cool a normal size bedroom. After 19 days the fan went down to the lowest setting and was not able to cool unless one stood directly in front of it. It was not worth the money paid.
Small but powerful..remote control is a joke. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's not.
I will start with the negative. The remote control does not work very well. You must be close to the fan in order to operate the remote. Very frustrating when you spend $100 for something that doesn't work as well as it should.When you run at high speed it is quite noisy.On a positive note it is very efficient at moving the air. It is also economical to use... with the brushless motor. Overall I would say I am dissatisfied with this product. I will be returning it.
I love lysol spray in clean linen but everytime. I buy it anymore it quits spraying 1/4 into the can. Nothing makes it work. Cannot be wasting like that.
The sprayer always stops working. I can never make it through an entire large can. Always seems like 3/4 left, and it stops spraying. I cant justify buying the large cans any longer.
I purchased a large 19 oz can of Disinfected spray and half of the can is still in there and it quit spraying I have clean the tip and ran hot hot water over it and it still does not work. I would e-mail directly to Lysol but it won't let me.
I like Lysol and need Lysol to spray for germs however the spray nozzle always seems to stop working and Lysol isn't cheap wish they could fix this issue
Bought two cans and last month, they both stopped spraying and they are still half full. What's with the lousy nozzles Ive been buying this for years and never had any problems until this summer.
I love this product for its disinfectant capabilities and there is no other product I have found to be better on killing germs that I trust around my children and pets. HOWEVER, of the last 6 cans I have purchased not one had a working spray nozzle on it. You could push down all you wanted and a little squirt might come out if you shook the tar out of it while you were at it and the cans are still full, a few even worked until about 1/3 of the can was used. I cannot begin to say how frustrating it is to throw away money. I tried everything like running the nozzles under hot water the way you do for hairspray etc, nothing works and the stores won't take them back!
I have been to three grocery stores in my area and they only carry scented Lysol. I have used Lysol my entire life and have never had this problem. I begrudgingly bought some linen scent recently for the bar, but it smelled horribly strong. I also use Lysol for sports equipment such as my running and climbing shoes. The last thing I need is to show up at the gym smelling like a bowl of potpourri. Please make scent less Lysol and distribute it nationwide. There is a HUGE demographic of people who will not use scented disinfectants. People are asking for this. It is a big deal! I love the disinfectant properties of Lysol. That is the reason so many people use it!
I have used Lysol products for many years. However, my last few purchases have been disappointing. With alot of the product still left inside, the sprayer nozzle no longer works. Nothing comes out . I feel like I have thrown hard-earned money away, as I no longer have my receipt to be able to return. This happened on 2 of the 19 oz and one 12.5 oz cans. Please fix this issue. Thank you for your time.
Hello Lysol, I loved your unscented Lysol spray. Using it made everything seem clean and sanitary. Unfortunately, since you only have the scented products available, I have stopped using it because scents and artificial perfumes cause me respiratory problems. Please bring back the unscented spray. kbh
Lysol Disinfectant spray is one of my favorite products, but the last 3 cans of spray I have bought have become clogged and the spray doesn't come out after only a few uses. I had to throw 2 full cans away because it won't spray and now the third can is clogging up. I tried running the nozzle under warm water and that helps for a a while, but it is a hassle. I will not purchase it again because it is getting expensive to throw out full cans that do not work.
I purchased a 19 oz can of Lysol disinfectant spray about a month ago. The can quit spraying once I had used about half of the can's contents. I have tried rinsing the nozzle in hot water, but that didn't resolve my issue. I don't like the idea of tossing the can out with half of the product still inside. What else can I do
I use Lysol neutra air sanitizing spray everyday, but the last 3 cans i have purchased the spray button stops working and im stuck with a can half full....Is there a way to change the spray i want to continue to use the spray but im waisting money if i cant use the whole bottle....I think your products are a 5 star when it comes to cleaning....just wished the spray button worked better......thx for listening
I tried viewing it on several devices without success. Bestbuy customer service are excellent
Just doesn't have the heart or character design of Disney animated films.
This movie I purchased could not even occupy my Neice and Nephew. Not recommended.
The previews for this animated movie made it seem cute and child friendly. It was not. It was chalk full of poorly written jokes by good comedians, doing something they are not accustomed to doing; voice work. Louie C.K. has always been brilliant, barring this $25.00 blu-shiny coaster.
Should have rented this movie first. Funny premise but didn't deliver. Not necessarily a good kids movie.
We should have rented this one instead of buying it.
Wasn't to impressed, the previews show you most of the funny parts, the rest is just another remake of Saturday morning cartoon plots
All the funny parts are in the trailers. I would not recommend buying this.
Hmm, this movie is not as funny as I have expected from watching the trailer.
Purchase the combo pack as we have both dvd & blue ray players. First time out of box ( handled by adult) all it did was stop and skip. Upon inspection damaged before receipt. Have yet to try blue ray
Kids like it but it is the same as we seen before no different
The trailers made this movie look hilarious and original, but it turns out to be just a conventional caper with a few funny moments.
I was hesitant on this from the beginning in my opinion all the best parts are in the trailer, and they don't even show the plot in the trailer.
The movie's best and funniest scenes are in the trailer. The whole movie plot is silly but the little kids would love it.
I thought the movie would have a different story theme
I was expecting better, especially since the trailer was hilarious. Some of the inferred violence, with the animals talking about killing their owners, YIKES!!
Original idea. Executed poorly. It's just simply not funny.
Well, this wasn't what I was hoping for when I purchased this movie. Turns out that ALL of the funny scenes were in the preview trailers. I'm glad that I purchased this movie on the Deal of the Day sale, otherwise I would be pretty mad. It was worth the $4.99 sale price though.
my kids loved it but I feel asleep and I love cartoons. To slow and not funny enough.
I thought the movie was boring. Gave it to a freind.
I was hoping for more comedy and more of a plot line surrounding pets while their owners are away. Instead, I got an archetypal adventure story of two unlikely friends.
the movie started out very cute and what I expected but ended up being not very good - but looked great on 4k tv and dvd player!!
But I'll be honest. My wife made me watch this movie and I didn't really enjoy it all that much. To be fair we take turns on what to watch on the weekends and this was her pick. Don't get me wrong it looked absolutely fantastic but I can't get into movie like this.
While I figured this would be a clever and fun movie about what pets do while we're not home, I have to admit this was easily a forgettable film.
I ended up answering emails rather than watch all this movie. It was silly at best.
My kids love this movie. They are 11 and 13. I am an adult. Suffice to say it did not hold my attention. If you thought Minions was a highly annoying mess of a film, then this one won't be as painful. It's still not great.
This movie isn't even close to as good as it has been advertised as being. We almost didn't get through it. It isn't very good. There are a couple 'laugh out loud' moments ... but you've seen them in the trailers already. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this movie ... rent only, maybe, and then forget it forever.
Not meant for kids younger than 4. The comedy is eh and the plot was eh. I wouldn't recommend spending $25 on it.
My wife wanted and bought this. I did not want to see it in the theater. We watched it this last weekend. Interesting modern animation. The plot was NOT what I figured it was going to be about. I fell asleep twice during watching it. Our cats even got bored and took a nap. Kids will enjoy it.
The picture quality was great, but I found the movie to b a little boring.
This DVD had a protective watermark that prevented us from watching it without interruption. We are returning it as management instructed. they were very helpful and the movie is great...just watching the DVD with the interruption was a pain.
Did not like the movie and did not finish watching it
My children? Thoroughly amused for most of the duration of the movie. Some adult humor and references inappropriate for the rating. I can watch it with my family though so not a total waste.
All of the best jokes were in the trailer. Expecting combinations of adult and child humor but more for kids
bought the 6 double rolls equal 12 of ultra plus the starting glue was so thick it ruined every roll This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Have been using this product for some time. Recently, though, I can not help but notice the 3 ply sheets separating. WHY So now I prefer the 2 ply
But it is still soft and comfortable paper. If instructions to use less were supplied, it would be good.
Use it as happy Will use again product does what they say
But it is still soft and comfortable paper. If instructions to use less were supplied, it would be good.
I bought it love it .but can't afford I'd it.why you don't get enough on a roll 1 was using 3xs more product . Not gapping
We have used charmin ultra strong forever. I tried this and was disappointed. The layers are thin and rip or roll. With small children using it ripping toilet paper is the worst, no one wants kids with 2 on their fingers. It's not the worst tp ever but I won't buy it again.
I bought mega roll 2 days ago because that's all that was in stock. The paper is not as thick as previous product and yet a higher price. I will be trying a different brand.
he Quilted Northern is the best , I have found . I will continue to use this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Although I appreciate the attempt to provide 'extra plush' comfort it results in small pieces of the tissue being left behind. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Don't order this! The product is amazing but it is listed here as 16.9oz and the product they ship is only 13.5oz... A 20 percent difference! Very misleading and then of course when you call customer service they barely speak English and aren't helpful. Disappointing!
I didn't really like the smell of the lotion, and while it made my skin feel moisturized, it left me feeling itchy.
I dont like that smell off that boby wash

This conditioner, used along with the shampoo, made my scalp break out. I made sure each was rinsed thoroughly, but eventually had to toss them both. I thought it did well on my hair, but the scalp problem was not very pretty.
This shampoo and conditioner seem watery. It does lather ok, but I had to use more than normal.
i think that is a very good product i love.it also gives shine ti my hair and gives life.
I have salon colored hair, which I return to have touched up every 6-8 weeks. I tried this conditioner along with the shampoo. My salon sells Loreal Professional Products which are amazing. I think this would be fine if your hair was normally good condition and didn't use heat styling tools every day. (I blow dry, and straighten and/or curl everyday.) So my hair probably needs a little big more help. But this is a great everyday shampoo if you just want to keep your hair color fresh.
Could not handle the smell of it.
I bought this product about a year ago and recently repurchased it. The first time around it was amazing but this time I bought the same shade (the lightest one available) and it was much darker than before. I wish there were more shade options for both fair and dark skintones. The formula is awesome but the shade range could use some work.
Just not for me.
This is just another makeup product that looks great in the ads but does not work as they say it does. I found the cap almost impossible to get off, then it says to twist the bottle two-three times to get the product out. I was banging it on the counter and turned it 10-15 times and finally I got some of the product out. After I applied it as the bottle says I saw very few if any results. I was very disappointed since I expected it to work as advertised. Luckily it wasn't all that much but the money could have been better spent.
I bought the brightener color and I was very pleased. First time I've ever used a brightener on my eyes. It was easy to apply and really opened my eyes. It made me look refreshed and younger! It didn't erase wrinkles or fine lines by any means, but it did make my eyes look awake and more youthful. I'm disappointed that it ran out so quickly! I only used it maybe 2 dozen times And it was gone. One minute I'm happily applying it and the next it's gone. I'm going to try to open the bottle because it looks like there is a bunch left in the bottle but the applicator is a waste. The sponge absorbs too much of the concealer. Bad applicator design. I won't buy it again because I think the cost is not worth just a few weeks of product
I struggle with dark under eye circles and overall this product was not beneficial for me. Upon applying, the product felt greasy and was hard to rub into my face. If they put this formulation in a tube with a doe-foot applicator I would probably be willing to try in that format but if you are going to spend 7 on a concealer I would personally recommend the covergirl ready set gorgeous concealer. **BONUS I have extremely fair skin and this concealer's lightest shade was still darker than my actual face but the covergirl one mentioned above was light enough to look natural and brighten the under eye area.
This concealer is NOT a favorite - the lightest shade it's available in is too dark and too yellow for me (especially my undereyes), and it creases so hardcore. I've tried it with three different foundations and the only way I can get it to not crease so bad is if I don't wear foundation at all, and even then it's still pretty bad. It feels like nothing on the skin, and it dries to an almost satin finish, which I like, but the cons FAR outweigh the pros.
Let's start with the pros: I bought this because I heard a lot of hype about it. I got it in shade fair, and it is a perfect shade match for me considering I'm light-skinned with pink undertone. It's easy to apply even though it has a unique applicator, you just have to twist it a lot when you first get it to get product out. It blends well, and I would say it is medium/high-medium coverage. Now for the cons: the concealer does crease, but it's not a big deal as long as you set your under-eyes. However, this concealer, for whatever reason, always emphasizes my skin/texture when other concealers don't. I don't understand why- yes I prep my face beforehand, etc. It's easily noticeable that I'm wearing concealer under my eyes which doesn't happen with my other concealers (maybe because my other ones are high-end idk.) Not only does it make my under-eyes look textured, but it also doesn't layer on top of some foundations/bb creams well. Sometimes it works okay, sometimes it's a mess that ruins my makeup. The main way I am able to use it is if I'm just going to wear concealer under my eyes with no foundation. Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one, idk. I wouldn't recommend this concealer, unfortunately.
Wanted to try something new...this does not cover nearly as well as my usual concealer/dark circle cover up. Won't buy again.
I really love the feel of this concealer. It's not cakey or heavy, feels almost like gel and has a good coverage. But the bottle broke the first time I tried it. I tried to put I picture of thr bottle on here but it doesn't work :/
Love the product , but hate, hate, hate the delivery system. The product is useless if you can't apply it. Won't buy again.
This product is not worth the money!
This product claims to instantly erase dark circles, fine lines and diminish puffiness but it only does one of those things. It works ok on dark circles. I purchased this product in hopes that it would help with a few of the fine lines I have under my eyes but instead it made them look WAY worse. Very disappointed.
This product has a nice finish and blend ability which is why I gave it two stars but the coverage is not great nor did it fade dark circles. Wouldn't repurchase since it settles into lines too.
I loved this product upon first use. I have dark circles and have only found one product in the past to cover them, unfortunately it's an expensive department store purchase. The Instant Age Rewind Eraser has a wonderful applicator tip that provided flawless coverage at a great price. I saw a reduction in puffiness too. However, the twisting mechanism broke after only one week of daily use! Disappointing, Maybelline!
This is a good product but the packaging is a real problem. It takes way too long to get it going and then when you do ... it breaks. I've tried three different ones and have had the same problem each time. Even though it's inexpensive you don't get your money's worth because it breaks before you get to the bottom. Put it in a squeeze tube and be done with it ... it's a no-brainer.
I love this product and have bought it at least six times, but have had faulty applicators in four out of the six times. The twist applicator stops working so the concealer does not get to the sponge applicator and I have to revert to my stick concealer. As much as I love this product, I will not buy this product again since I throw away most of it. Corporate should repackage this product.
I bought this product based on several Youtube reviews and I was impressed... at first. I find that it creases in the fine lines under my eyes soon after applying, even if I set it with powder. I will finish what I have and definitely not repurchase.
The spongy applicator doesn't give much to go around. I'd rather use my fingers to apply the concealer. I have really dark under eye circles and puffiness and this has not done any wonders for me. I'd rather use the 1 elf concealer that works better
I liked the concealer coverage and smoothness...but after about a month the packaging failed to work...couldn't get anymore out and the applicator just kept coming right out of the tube. Now i'm wondering if this applicator has been improved before I buy again. Can I get my money back
I really do love this product. It brightens up my under eye area and looks awesome, during winter. The only downside is the limited availability in shades. Once I start getting even REMOTELY darker this product is completely useless.
I really do love this product but after buying a brand new replacement one the twist up mechanism broke before I even was able to use it. Just seemed like I spent a decent amount for nothing. Not sure If I will purchase again
I instantly fell in love with this concealer, but before I was even a quarter of the way through the tube it started clogging, the applicator became all smushy is loose I have to attempt to hold it in place while trying to put it on. Wasted my
The applicator on this product does not last. Therefore you can't even use up the product in the applicator because the sponge top comes off after minimal usage.
I purchased after seeing all the rave reviews on YouTube. It didn't do for me what it did for them. I wanted to conceal under eye circles but I guess mine are too heavy for this product. I returned.
I bought this product twice thinking it was me but it broke after only a few times of use each purchase. Very disappointed in the packaging. Never buy it again.
I just got this product after using a friend's. The coverage is awesome and I didn't have a problem with packaging. The smell, however is very distracting.
I just bought the item and cannot get the applicator to work. I'm able to open the tube to get to the product, but it's unpractical to have to do that.
love the product..but after one use, I couldn't get the product up to the sponge. Very frustrating and a waste of the entire product!
It's a beautiful mirror, but I didn't like it because the lighting seems to obscure your face. I couldn't see better, it was worse. I've had an unlighted wall mounted mirror for many years and I thought the lighted one would be better, but it's not. I'm returning it.
Used pans over two weeks now. I use a soft cleaning pad to clean my pans and overall the anodized coating is coming off. Not good.
I don't like the fabric it's made of. I am afraid the outside is gonna get stained. It was shipped with marks on it. It's kinda small.
I am making a memory album for our thirtieth wedding anniversary and wanted something expandable. The description lead me to believe this could be expanded and it is book bound and not expandable. Do not have time to order something else so will have to make do. Extremely disappointed
This mask has a nice texture and consistency as well as a good smell. After applying this mask and following the directions I have to say I think this was a little too harsh on my skin. I have very sensitive skin that gets dry pretty easily and I was not a big fan of this product. I received a free sample of this product and was very excited to try it out, but I was disappointed.
I brought this used it and afterwards pimples came on my face the same day in to point five seconds I don't know why but I'm nervous on why should I stop using it or is that suppose to happen
It didn't taste all that great. It was OK - kind of small too.
The few pieces of chicken I did have were all gristle and had to be spit out. Have never had a problem with the meals before but this one missed the mark.
I bought this and a couple of LC Sunday and while I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the sauce and good amount of rice, I was disappointed with the lack of CHICKEN in a dish called sweet sour CHICKEN. Honestly it has always been my complaint about LC, the amount of chicken/mean NEVER looks like the cover picture. For some reason I'd thought things would be different because of the nice new black boxes. Nope, still only 2 chunks of chick which probably equal about 1oz of chicken if not less. I gave the meal 2 stars because I did like the flavor, but now will have to make my own at home and save .
Although the sauce was very good there was not a single piece of chicken in the meal I just prepared. The last box I bought only had one little piece of chicken.
The food is Lean Cuisine quality... You know, not a 5-star meal but it's better than PBJ sandwiches. Biggest issue with this one is the sauce. I taste sweet, but no sour. Needs some improvement.
I had the new Marketplace Sweet Sour Chicken, the taste is good, you get 5 little piece of chicken and a ton of Rice! Over 50 of this product is Rice. I like most of Lean Cuisine products but this one need some improvement. To MUCH WHITE RICE
This uses to be a favorite but that was when it had separate rice and ingediants to hear. Its nothing like that now. Looks nothing like the photo. Chunks of chicken skin and hard ends of green pepper are not on the ongediant list. I won't be recommending this soggy mess. Not will I buy it again!
For starters, I am using another brand of shampoo, so I'm not using it "for best results." With that out of the way, I feel like the formula is not very consistent. Even though it looks like I use the same amount every time I shower, sometimes as I apply the conditioner it feels like I didn't put very much in, and other times it feels fine. I have a lot of split ends and breakage from growing my hair out, and I don't find that my hair breaks any less. Many times my hair gets really static-y after it dries; one would think static would be reduced because hair is "nourished" and conditioned. I also don't find the scent of the conditioner to be all that pleasant.
I do not like the food containers. They do not click when I close them and they rarely seal properly. I do however love the bags and resealable bags.
Bought 6 and all loose their vacuum within about 6 hours
I am waiting to be impress by your product (10 cup foodsaver), but not yet. I have read the instruction and the vacuum seal last for a few hours and then the indicator show that the seal has been lost. It's a great idea, and I am a long time customer. However, it this does not work I will only purchase bags for my food saver.
Hello FoodSaver, Thank you for asking for our opinions on your newest improved container design as we certainly feel it's important to help you to understand your customer's needs and views. We bought these containers to add to and somewhat replace our older FoodSaver containers of four years ago. Though they have a few improved features, there are some issues we found somewhat disappointing. We enjoy the new dimple vacuum indicator feature, the stack-ability, the new material of harder plastic which is easer to clean up and makes it top-rack dishwasher safe, and the easy lid disassembly for dishwashing too. Where we feel your design has fallen down a bit, is in the closure and opening ease of use. It takes quite a few times to get any of the containers to close properly for sealing and vacuum tightness. We match up the small tabs on the lid container bodies, but this doesn't seem to help. When sealing, the container adaptor for the vacuum hose always needs to be held on to the container lid port. Even though it seems to seat a bit better onto the lid port than the older models, it doesn't seem to grip in place as it should. We always need to hold down by hand on both the adaptor and lid with some pressure to help the port and the container lid make contact in order to start the sealing process. When opening the container, it is Always a Major struggle after the air is released. Trying to grip the lid and then separate the lid away from the main container body is an issue does not open easily without wrestling with both. A more elongated lid lip with which to grip onto may help, or some kind of snap-ability between body lid would facilitate easier usage, which the older containers have. We are a middle aged, healthy, dexterous, and agile couple who have No issues with any arthritic or carpal limitations. If we were senior adults with some kind hand arthritic condition, these containers would most definitely be impossible to use and manipulate. Even though there are so many improvements with these new containers, they are not as easy to use as our older ones, where you actually could snap the lid into place and the adapters seated well and firm on the lid ports. Please relate this to your engineering, design, and quality control teams and see if you can find some solutions for an even Better design. Thank you for taking the time and energy to consider our comments. Faithfully, Jimi Isaacs
I'm having a problem with this 10 cup container. Not sure if it's the blue lake green beans or if it's defective. I put my green beans from my garden in it until I have enough to can and it won't stay sealed. Each time I add more I make sure it is totally dry so it will seal but within a day or 2 it's no longer sealed. My peppers are doing fine in the 8 cup container. No problem there, just the 10 cup.
The first week I received these, I had no problem with them sealing, although they would lose their seal within a day or so. I've only washed them by hand...no dishwasher...and don't see any cracks in them, but no matter what I do, I cannot get them to seal. I've tried using the adapter that came with the containers and also the adapter that came with the machine, but neither work.
I bought this as part of a 3 piece set and so far both the 3 cups fail to hold a seal for very long. I've used them now for a few weeks and every time within a few hours the seals are gone.
I bought 2 of these and only got one to seal correctly. Many here had similar experience I thought oh they didnt follow the directions. No, I followed all directions multiple times. The info states a fill line I dont see one marked. The suction is there I have no issue with the unit itself.
I bought this set. The ten quart lid has a slight warp so I have to hold the lid and the bottom together using both hands. Should have been born with three hands so I could use the handheld sealer on my 5860. I called Foodsaver and they sent me a new one. Same problem.Luckily I have a FM 1510 and can use that to seal while I hold the lid and bottom together on both ends to start a vacuum. I am curious if others have the same problem. The three, five and eight quart containers work perfectly. I have six of each. The ten is the bummer. I would not buy another one. Better to invest in the smaller sizes. The eight is my favorite.
I've used this several times but have not had much success. The seal seems to gradually loosen over a few days and the food doesn't seem to stay any fresher/longer than when I put it in cheap plastic containers. Disappointed.
Sometimes the seal does not work when I try to seal something. Often when I go to the refrigerator the container is no longer sealed.
I have been a Foodsaver for the last dozen years or more. However, I'm having the same trouble as many others with the unreliable seal on these containers. To their credit, this site has replaced one set of the new containers for me but not all I purchased. The new ones seem to work a bit better but the seals are still unreliable. I am not a novice. I keep the seals and valve clean, I have never put them in the dishwasher and in fact, always wash the lids by hand and never immerse them. I have been forced to check the seals regularly and reseal often - not what I bargained for. I have had some luck by rotating the lids to find, perhaps, if there is one rotation that seals better and then placing a small mark with permanent marker to help me use the placement that might seem to hold the seal longer. I swear some of these lids in the early manufacturing runs are warped. Sometimes I can rotate the lids to find a placement that doesn't pop up but those warped lids are hopeless and I just boxed them up and put them out in the shed until I figure a fix. (I used to help the marinator seal with a bit of vegetable oil on the seal and that seemed to help keep them sealed a bit longer but who knows. When I press them on, I can feel them pop back up - no wonder they don't seal reliably. Some are not warped. Occasionally, they will surprise me and hold the seal for a longer period but I still can count on them and must constantly go to the pantry to check to make sure my saltines or pastas are still sealed so that they don't go rancid on me too quickly but I am running out of counter space for those containers that seem to require daily re-sealing or in some cases, every six hours or so. I have tried to determine if these new containers work better in the fridge or out and they remain non-reliable for the most part no matter the environmental conditions. I have reverted to the old round canisters for storage of most dry foods as they seem to hold their seals longer. For the convenience in storing rectangular containers, I was really rooting for these to work reliably but alas... Back to the drawing board folks!
Have bought foodsaver fresh containers before this purchase but this container lid does not fit well and does not seal well.
I love the look of my containers but after 24 hrs my seal no longer is down. All four containers seals popped up after 24 hrs when we tested them. It was disappointing
Nice containers, but don't hold a vacuum to the next day. I've submersed in water to figure out where/how air is leaking in, but to no avail. Mostly useless as a vacuum sealed container system
They replaced my top lid for the 2.5 quart one and the replacement was a little better but slowly leaked. I ended up throwing it away.
These units, although well constructed, don't hold a seal for very long. Lucky if I can get a day out of them. Your other cylindrical containers with the beige lids, work perfectly. You should design these after those type of containers.
I have bought three of these containers at various sizes, and every one has lost it's seal after a few days....because it's happened with all the different containers, it appears to be a design/manufacturing flaw. Just for the doubters, I meticulously clean the sealing gasket and the rim before using each time AND run through the ENTIRE vacuuming cycle when sealing...so it's not user error.
My food saver cover crack when i take the air out to the large container i have vegetable in
I got this as a sample to review how I liked it. But it didn't come with any tray saver, so I had to order that first which I thought was inappropriate if I was sent it to give a review on. Therefore, I really couldn't give it a fair review at this point. But I did try to seal some bread in it and it failed to vacuum seal. Maybe I did something wrong I don't know. I thought Foodsaver brand was supposed to be easy This wasn't easy for me at all. But I wish it was, because I really wanted to enjoy using it so I could buy the whole set !! Now I'm not so sure what I want to do I'll keep trying...But I hope I don't keep failing !! Thanks for the container, Food Saver !! Let's hope I can get it to work. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
First, I would like to say that I love the idea, the quality of the plastic, and the set in general. When it works, it is excellent, as it keeps food fresh, and you can continue to reuse it over and over. However, there are a couple of issues I have with this item. It can be a major pain to get it to work at all. Often times, it is a toss up on when the device wants to behave or not. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't feel like I'm doing anything differently from the times it works versus the times it doesn't. Also, another major flaw is that the few times you get lucky and it actually worked, you may find that it was a false positive after all as you will notice that sometimes the dimple to let you know the air is sucked out ends up losing it's suction. This is after less than a day in the fridge. So it is a constant struggle between getting the containers to work at all and getting it to stay vacuumed. However, like I said, the few times when it works as intended, it is excellent as it has kept the suction for weeks on some items. If you are okay with the above frustrations and love the idea of these containers, go ahead and get them. At the very least, you can use them by itself as decent good looking containers. If, however, all of this seems like a huge exercise in frustration, look elsewhere.
I've been using these containers for a few weeks now. They are very finicky to seal, you cannot just place the lid on the container and sealyou must make sure all the connections are are tight and hold the lid down onto the container. Many times it take a couple of tries to get things just right for a seal. I've used both the food saver handheld vacuum and my actual vacuum sealer machine. After sealing them and placing them in the fridge, many containers leak air and lose their seal. I have followed all the trouble shooting tips: do not store gas-emitting foods, make sure gaskets are clean and dry, etc. In summary, I'm glad I bought these on sale. I would not want to pay full price based on the performance. Double check your containers everyday to make sure they are still sealed.
I bought one of these and used it three times successfully. Then it stopped sealing. Is it possible that this cannot last if put into a dishwasher Not willing to buy again.
Impressed by one 3c container rec'd as gift. Waited 2mo for containers to be in stock. Ordered 4 container set. Initially impressed with container construction, appearance, stackability and capacities. Upon unpacking and wiping clean, vac'd each container. The black green adapter stem is smaller in diameter than gray one. Does work with hand held vac but not well. Leaks around stem. On the containers only one held vac 3hrs (10c). Tried several times. Washed in warm water and tried again. Same results w/5c 8c. Over next 2 weeks tried storing fresh fruits, leftovers and just empty containers. Cleaned lid seals vac valves with Q-tip to ensure clean. None of the containers held vac 1day. Although size and construction very good w/o vac just expensive storage containers. Ended up returning. The 3c I still have has had lid seal removed, cleaned and inspected under magnifier. Can't see any damage but still will not hold vac 8hrs.
Small container is too small. Sealed containers are too hard to separate.
these are very sturdy and good looking containers. love the color. what i dont love is that they do not retain the suction when sealed. when i fill them Nd initially get a good seal i can check them next day and it no longer retains the suction seal. i had read reviews before purchasing this set and thought maybe was just user error or possibly just a bad set of containers but i am getting the same lack of results. would not recommend this product and find this set useless for air tight storage. only wish i could return them
Tired of throwing away fresh produce and got these as my Food saver bags work great for all sorts of things.

One of the containers will not stay sealed.
The product image is for a 4.5 watt light bulb, while the product description is for a 10 watt bulb. This is a big discrepancy!
I have been using Oxy face wash for most of the last 25 years. It has changed ownership, and the formula has been modified a few times, but my skin always responded well to it. This latest formulation irritates my skin and makes it break out! I don't get full-blown pustules, thankfully, but it has caused little bumps all over my face as if all my pores are clogged. I have stopped using it over the last couple of days, and those bumps are already flattening and drying out.

If you want an album like their first release, you will be sadly disappointed.
I miss the OLD PANIC!What happened? They went from "dead skin on the lenolium floor" to "Because I see sinshine in her eyes."They've become wannabee Beatles.Where'd the creepy "I-wanna-go-watch-a-horror-movie" vibe? Where's the techno-y sound?Maybe it left with their exclamation point.Sorry, Panic. This album just went down and exploded.I don't see how people say this is amazing. It's all been done before.Seriously, Panic has dissapointed me, a fan of a few years.
Product nutragena dark spot remover. still have them so what now I use all nutragena poducts, and have been very happy until now
First off, I love Neutrogena products. Have used them most of my life. Now that I'm older, I'm noticing those sun spots, dark spots, from age and sun. When I first started using the product, I did notice a slight difference in one or two of the dark spots. However, I started noticing that several of them started to look like the skin around them was turning lighter, and the dark spot was not fading anymore. As if that wasn't enough, I've gained MORE dark spots, and something is causing me to break out in areas I wouldn't normally have break-outs! The spots that I have (had were never super dark, just noticeable, but now there are more! Not to mention, the ones that I had seem as though they've increased in size and have become more noticeable. I do not get out in the sun at all these days so that cannot be a factor. Even if I do, I will always wear sunscreen. This was my twice daily regimen: 1. Wash with Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Foaming face wash. 2. Pore Refining Toner 3. Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Correcting Serum concentrating on discolored areas. 4. Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer day or night). 5. Rapid Wrinkle Repair eye cream. I wonder if anyone else has had any issues such as these. I really wish the product would have worked for me. I really don't understand why it's causing me opposite effects.
I used this religiously morning and night for 2 full weeks. Product said I would see results within 1 week. Well, I did not. My age spots still looked the same. However, the product did have a pleasant smell. It didn't feel gooey or sticky on my face and worked well under my powdered make-up.

I debated about buying these and should have known better than to buy the big container. When I opened the drawer to put my next pod in, there was all this blue and orange goop with the outside casing left behind. Hope they go back to the drawing board at PnG on this one!
Unfortunately these pods have left residue on my clothes with every load. I have to pay per w/d load so it's literally money down the drain. I want to love them, but at this point it's money wasted.
I have a new HE washer and continued to use Tide liquid for all my washing as I had done before. Then I started adding Tide Boost. Everything was OK until this month. I have done two washes that the white items have come out light blue! Nothing was in either wash that had not ben washed before. I now have three white shirts the most awful color light blue!
I had been using the powdered TIDE HE, but recently had to buy the liquid with original scent. The fragrance was strong and irritated both my husband's and my eyes during a load of wash (the washing machine is in the kitchen area). The dried clothes still had the perfume smell which I personally find offensive. I would really like the product without any fragrance.
i have used Tide liquid and was happy with that. BUT!!!! this product does not dissolve properly i have had stains on my shirts, i had red and blue undissolved soap i am not happy with this product.
I thought this was a cool product and was satisfied with the results until I noticed blue spots on one of my favorite white cotton t-shirts. I never had this problem with regular liquid detergents, and I hope the spots wash out. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
LG front load, new in 2010. I have washed over 30 loads - there are no soap suds in the window, clothes are not nearly as clean as using the tide liquid that I have always used in the past. Stains do not come out, odor is not pleasant (not unpleasant, but not fresh). I have already purchased ordinary tide liquid, because I know it works, these pods look clean/nice/efficient, but they are not very good in my machine.
When it comes to laundry detergent I only use the Tide brand. Typically I use liquid Tide, but thought I would try the Tide pods. Even when following the directions of how to use the Tide pods, I have had many items of clothes ruined because of this product. While I've had the previously mentioned purple stains, the most frequent happening is the outer plastic melting into clumps on the clothing. Overall, stick to the liquid!
No worries though, they aren't ruined. I soaked my clothes in the wash with a cup of vinegar and it all came off.
its been a long time since I used any detergent that wasn't fragrance free. I'm allergic to it, so I used this on my husbands clothes. They cleaned up fine. But they wreaked of detergent.
Convenient but only work if you use two pods per normal size load. This make them a terrible value. Like most products from PG these days lack luster at best.
this is just another attempt to say laundry detergent has improved. well lets go back to when we had biz enzyme now there was a stain lifter for some reason whenever there is product that works it is pulled from the market and the consumer is never advised why. When you had a stain the enzyme would immediately go to work as a pre-soak now i don't know if it hurt the environment or what but that was absolutely the best product on the market for stain removal someone needs to look back in the archives and find this one and redo this one.
I've unfortunately had the same experience with blue gummy stains as many here. They were not permanent, I was able to soak the clothes and scrape the solid portions off. It took a few times to realize it was the pods causing this. It would have saved quite a bit of hassle if I'd realized sooner. When they do dissolve fully, they seem to do a fine job cleaning and I like how they smell. For my cold washes, I now use something else and save these for my hot water loads only. No sense at all to have to dissolve first, and then add, as some here have recommended. It defeats the whole purpose of having a 'pod.' I still like Tide and am willing to bet they aren't the only company with the pod problem. So, I'm disappointed. It is a good idea, but still needs some work. Changing to warmer water settings is unrealistic for most of my work clothes. I don't pack the washer, but I do fill it, and don't have any problems with other detergent types. I'll use up what I have left in my hot washes and I won't buy these again.
I like Tide. I have used other detergents and came back to Tide, because I found in the long run it's a better value. It may cost more, but it works better than other brands and so I find it's worth the extra money spent. However, I have tried the new pods twice now. I don't remember which scent I chose the first time, but the second time I chose the Alpine Breeze. This time I am noticing that my cotton clothes seem to have retained an odd smell. It's hard to describe, but it is definitely NOT pleasant. The best way I can find to describe the odor is that it smells like a homeless person. None of my clothes had this smell before I laundered them and I cannot think of any other reason they might smell this way. I definitely won't be using the Alpine Breeze scent ever again. Most likely, I'll just go back to using the liquid Tide. While I like the convenience of the pods, I just don't find it measures up to the additional cost for me.
I have been a Tide user forever. Anytime I try a brand I am disappointed. I love the idea of the Tide pods for making the laundry one tiny bit easier. I started noticing purple stains on my husbands white t-shirts (just about the only white clothes in my household). I could not figure out what he was doing to get these stains. And then I realized they werent on the shirts BEFORE I washed them and it occurred to me that its from the Pods. I do everything right... Pod in first, not overloading at all, not using delicate, cycle runs a full-length, wash in warm, etc. But still we get stains every time on whatever shirt happened to be sitting on top of the pod. Very disappointing. Fortunately for me these are all undershirts, so not visible. And the stain does eventually wash out on its own. No more pods for me. Im giving the Gain pods a try right now, but Im guessing Tide liquid will be back on my list. These should NOT be used for whites of any kind.
I was really looking forward to the new pods but my sample arrived in mail squished and unable to use :(. I would like another sample so I can try these awesome little pods This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This little pod is a great idea but i do not think for our family it is strong enough. With the Tide powder I can have grass and red clay stain gone with one wash.. this pod does not do the trick. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I FELT THE TABS DIDNT GIVE OFF ENOUGH SOAP. I PREFER MY LIQUID TIDE DETERGENT This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Wish I could insert the pictures I took of my purple stained clothes, left behind pod gel in my machine and broken pods (about 6) in a newly opened canister. You really need to improve this product or else I will need to switch brands!
I am very excited by the convenience of Tide PODS. When will Tide PODS Detergent be available in a FREE Gentle formula Having sensitive skin PODS in GentleFree formula may be my only option. When will a Gentle Fee PODS Detergent be available
Just used my first pod and saw no suds I kept checking back but didn't see any.I am washing dark clothes so I can't tell if worked.
I bought the 90 count pods for the first time and the container I bought the pods were all stuck together. They were not cut aprt when being made, it is a mess they have leaked all over the container and I have to use 2 for some loads due to the leaking. some I even had to throw away. Dissapointed.
PLEASE bring back the original scent of the Original Tide. It was one of the main reasons I'd spend so much money on laundry detergent! I loved it so much and miss my clothes smelling so fresh! I don't like the new scent, and don't understand why it was changed. Please change it back!!!!!! Thank you!
The overall idea of a pod...one small quick-grab object that you can toss into the wash, no worries of over-pouring or messy spills...Convenient and Economic in one little pod! It was great that the individual film of the pod was made to quickly desolve...I like to visibly see the detergent react in the water. The down-side is that even in cool-kept temperatures, pods outer film will dissolve and what started great are dissolving one by one and the moisture from each, wets the next just enough to leak until they have all congeled together and you end up with a funny shaped bottle of detergent with a bunch of films that you now no longer want to go into your wash knowing they are no longer filled with detergent! Yes, a little disheartening ) However, I'd like to offer potential solutions. I start by saying that the convenience is not in the fact that there is film around each one...the convenience is in the fact that the servings are pre-measured. Fact is that many people do rather daunting work these days. I know Tide understands that, you wash our clothes! But when you get off of work after staring at a screen all day, you just want to relax your eyes, not look for small markings on the inside of a lid, not overpour and make a mess to have to clean! Simple is what you want. Think of an Exacto-Pour used to measure shots...if you were to upgrade your bottle for an easier carry (pod case is nice) and have a spout that would pre-measure each wash at the push of a button...Perfecto! Just a suggestion...Tide is still now and will always be my only brand! Thank you for being durable, reliable, safe and economic!
kind of expensive
I used Mountain Sping UltraTide. The days of Tide's stain-removal power seem to be long gone. It had no effect whatsoever on stains and the odor is cloying and overpowering. I've used Tide since 1968 but I really feel I must start experimenting and find a detergent that works like the old days.
I've used Tide, and only Tide for as long as I can remember. Today I brought home the Mountain Spring scent and its HORRIBLE. It made my whole house smell like cheap men's deodorant. What happened to your formula I have no idea if my clothes were clean enough because I had to run out and buy a different scent.
I used to love the pods, until I got to the middle of the bucket and found over 20 pods stuck together, I have used scissors, it has been a mess. Thanks, but no thanks, waste of money for me. The heat I don't know but yuck, money out the door.
I just did a load of lights and as I emptied the dryer folding everything I found the pod completely intact. I put it in the washing machine first, it was a large but not an oversized load of light weight items. I guess I'm really lucky it didn't open in the dryer, but now I have very nicely folded dirty clothes I have to wash again. I love the concept but I won't buy again.
I have used the tide pods for about a year now and I noticed there was soap in the clothes so I have to rewash all my loads just to to the soap out. Then I discovered that it works better if I dissolved it first ,so I let it sit in a cup of water,either hot or cold and then pour it in the machine a lot to have to do. Invent something else. Thank you.
Not happy with this product. I have been using Tide Pods for a few months now. I thought how easy to use and just the right amount to go in each load. Well since I have been using these my washer is getting more clogged. My washer is about 6 months old and should NOT be clogged. As this is the only product I have been using so these little pods are not desolving properly! I am now having to go back to liquid once more... so much for a great idea... ruins the washer in the long run!
I always use tide, and have tried the pods, for about 6months but will not buy anymore they always have one or two the bust and then they all stick together. then you lose about 10 to 12 pods because they all stick together.
Ive been using Tide pods for a few months and have come to love them. However, I just got a brand new high efficiency washer and have found that the pods do not dissolve completely! No matter which water temp setting I use, I wind up with a blue sticky residue on a couple items of clothing in the load. I'm disappointed, as the pods are so easy mess free. Not anymore. Back to liquid I go.
disappointed! the pods did not dissolve and one was stuck on my blouse and it melted in the dryer. They say you get what you pay for, in this case i did not.
Unfortunately, the only constant in the Tide family is Tide Powder. There are so many different formulations of Liquid Tide, it is hit or miss when trying them. Cold Water Tide does not clean any better than the formulations made for hot or cold water. The only certainty with the liquid Tide variations is that the Tide Free Clear does not in fact have any dyes or perfumes. I don't understand why the directions call for a larger measure of some the formulas, such as the Tide with Bleach. Proctor Gamble has even tinkered with the formula to what was in my opinion the best laundry detergent that they ever marketed - Cheer (both liquid powder). Stop trying to impress the consumer and get back to the basics. Make and market an effective and AFFORDABLE brand of laundry detergent. And, please, bring back ALL TEMPA-CHEER !
Nothing beats Tide detergent. However, I find the good old fashion Tide powder to be the best and have not really noticed any benefit of using the enhanced stain release formula.
In a new LG HE steam washer, one pod went through both the sanitary wash and hot dryer without dissolving. The load was top and bottom twin sheets, mattress protector and square of hospital sheeting. I've had them open and not completely dissolve but this is the first time finding one that went thru both machines unopened. I will be checking each load more careful.
The last two containers have left hard blue spots on my clothes. Put them in first. Do not overload and use warm water. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops and rewash my clothes.
I like to know hoe to remove the stains that the pods leave behind My laundry has stains from the pods. Dark shadow like on my cotton and polyester blend clothes.
I buy the original fragrance HE Tide. The fragrance was the main reason I liked the product. I just opened a new bottle, and surprise, it smells completely different. I checked the bottle thinking maybe I had mistakenly purchased something other than the original scent, rechecked my old bottle, and both read Original. This new fragrance is awful. My clothes smell like cheap perfume. I will buy one more bottle, hoping that there was a mix-up in some way, but if the second bottle smells the same I will not buy anymore.
i have a big problem with these pods because i have to wash my clothes twice because the pods leave a horrible residue on the first round! the residue is brown and always where i put the pod in. These are suppose to help with the laundry and in reality it makes it ever harder and worse. i know its now my washing machine because when i use other detergents it doesn't leave the residue. i purposely placed it on one of my shirts to see if it would leave residue there and guess what it did!! not only on my shirt but the whole load!! i am now washing for the second time but not with pods.
I've always loved the smell of laundry hung outside. My grandmother was a strong Tide user, so I loved the smell Tide from the clothes line. We got ourselves a HE washer 4 years ago, and I went with the HE Powdered detergent. The smell brought back my child hood. When I ran out, I ran to the store to get some, and they were out. I had to go liquid stuff.. I thought, well give it a try. Did my next load, and when that came out of the washer, the scent was STRONG! Ughh.. I could not stand it. Even my partner mention the strong scent! I still got the bottle sitting on my shelf since I refuse to use it on my clothes. Im back to the powdered stuff!
I bought the 77 count of Tide Pods. I've only gotten about half way through the container, and many of the pods have leaked, and there's a HUGE clump of pods stuck together. I can't get them apart without breaking them and further gumming up the contents of the container. I have to dig in the container to find pods that are still intact, and it's a mess. I wanted to use them all up, as they were expensive. I don't plan to buy pods again, and I won't recommend them to anyone. We've wasted a lot of money, and we weren't able to wash our clothing properly with Tide Pods. So disappointed.
My clothes are important, I expect them to pop' and be that clean. I didn't feel this happened. I miss the really fresh scent as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I use a shared laundry and have had trouble getting the pods to dissolve completely had a mess in the machine to clean up when cycle is done back to Tide liquid This review was collected as part of a promotion.
for a dress shirt. Washed it and it did not come out. Any ideas
Love the smell of these pods so I gave 2 stars...but it has stained all of my white clothing and T-shirts with purple streaks. I don't use any other products with my laundry either. I will not purchase again.
Tide is a great brand.The pods are nice since you don't have to measure. However, I washed a tablecloth with a gravy stain. I washed it 3 times and the stain did not come out. Therefore I was disappointed because I was looking to eliminate liquid detergent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I've been a long time user of Tide original and they've recently changed the scent for the worst. Now instead of smelling fresh and clean it smells like a heavy nauseating perfume. Until it gets changed back I will be looking elsewhere.
I tried my sample on the worst laundry I have, my construction worker husband's workclothes... The Convenience Factor was GREAT! Just pop and go but it did not get his clothes as clean as if I had pre-treated them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This is the first and last time I will use Tide Pods... I had to rewash my clothes because the pod did not dissolve completely and left a mess on my clothes. My time is valuable to me and using this was not a good use of my time. Very disappointed because Tide is the only thing I've ever used. Going back to my liquid Tide.

I thought the change of scent for the Original was me but apparently not. It's too strong, too perfumed and not enjoyable to wear clothing. I choose the Original because I do not like the other scents. Disappointing as I have used Tide for years and been very happy with laundry results. Just bought a new bottle and will have to suffer through it or give it away and shop for new brand. Rated it lower due to scent change.
I used this with cold water. The washer was about half full of water before I added clothes and the pod was not dissolving. It barely made any suds. After a few minutes of washing I noticed no suds but the water was a misty cloudy color. The clothes seemed to come out smelling fresh, but it not dissolving properly and turning the water into a cloudy color turns me off. I don't want bleached clothes.

I really like Tide pods, but like others here I was everything in cold water. I have 'blue gunk' appearing on my clothes and its very difficult to remove. If you don't notice it before drying the clothes, then (for example) socks will glue together and have to be thrown away. I really want this problem solved because I want to continue to use the product. The concept is great, and very easy to use.
I may have made a mistake but I put the pod in with one of my comforters and when I pulled the comforter out to put it in the dryer, the pod hadn't dissolved and I didn't realize that until I had dryed the comforter and had powder granules all over the floor when I pulled it out of the dryer. I will try it again but this caused more work in that I had to rewash and redry the comforter. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I was told by my step-mom to give tide pods a try. She uses them at their house, and says that they keep my brothers(who is disabled)clothes looking new even after accidents. We however, had not had such luck. I have had three experiences where the pod did not dissolve and left huge blue stains on our clothing. I prefer Tide over any other brand but I am disappointed by these Pods.
I'm not sure how, but the bag got moisture in it. Now, all the pods are stuck together. When I try to separate some of them, they pop all over...making things worse. Not sure that I will get these again. I had such high hopes. They seem to clean the laundry ok. We don't have extremely dirty laundry for the most part. I will probably just use the powder from now on....unless there is something I did wrong Dee
If only the pods cleaned and rinsed out well. I have a front load HE washer and it takes at least two full wash cycles to get all the suds out. And with the second no-detergent-added wash, i see a tub full of suds. Clothes don't come out smelling or feeling as clean as when I used the liquid--and I'll be switching back. The pods dissolved well, but needed hot water. What a disappointment and a waste of money.
Used Pods as directed didn't dissolve ruined clothes
My bag of tide pods literally melted away into a bag of messy liquid. They are like gremlins, DONT GET THEM WET OR BIG TROUBLE! When they don't melt, they do work well!
product too exspensive for the average family to use. also, it takes the color out of most fabrics if used to prespot. not too happy with this product
I have been a Tide user longer than I can remember. But I won't buy the pods any more. They don't dissolve in my front loader machine and leave a gunky mess. I still love Tide but am going back to Tide liquid which worked much better.
